4,False,"10 19, 2017",A18JLUE8V4G7TX,B017O9P72A,Uncle Rusty,"This skill works just fine, though I think a lot of issues some people have are due to spotty WiFi networks and a lack of understanding how the setup and commands work.

In particular, groups need to be created within the Alexa app itself or within the lifx app. You don't need to use the ""Tell lifx"" verbiage as some users have mentioned, and instead can use simple commands such as ""turn on the kitchen light"" or ""set the basement lights to 50% brightness"". The only limitation I'll complain about is that the number of recognized colors is limited to basic ones such as red, blue, orange, pink etc. It would be nice if more were recognized such as violet or magenta and so on.

I don't think most people realize how demanding having a bunch of lifx bulbs are on a WiFi network. Though they use little bandwidth, having multiple bulbs in a confined area causes a high probability of collisions and contention for access. Most people I see complaining about sporadic connectivity issues are running a basic router/wireless access point combo device. You really need to have a dedicated set of Access points depending on the size of your house. No matter how good your combo device is, the fact of the matter is CPU cycles have to be shared for both WiFi functions and routing and switching functions. The wifi controller logic within most combo devices is seriously lacking compared to a real prosumer or enterprise level AP.

Dedicated APs which support seamless roaming will simply provide a more stable network. If you're in an apartment unfortunately you're kind of out of luck due to high wireless interference from competing networks, but doing a basic 2.4 and 5ghz survey should help, or using an AP which has good auto channel detection would be ideal. I'd recommend at least a Ubiquiti AP setup for a good experience, as these APs are priced within consumer reach and don't have the extra tax attached to them. (No, your overpriced Asus router/AP with 10 antennas is not going to cut it, as despite the marketing push these devices fall flat compared to enterprise gear which only utilize 2-3 antennas)","This skill works just fine, though I think a lot of issues some ...",1508371200,5.0,,2112

After installing the native app for use at my mom's house to play around with, I took it home to use with my echo.  There are 2 ways to use it with Alexa, 1) smarthome mode.  You set this up from Alexa's smarthome menu (be sure to read the instructions.  I tried to intuit the method, but that didn't work).  This way is the easiest for turning the light on or off or set the intensity.  This mode doesn't require the ol' ""Tell/ask"" clumsy syntax.  2) skill mode.  Technically the first is a skill, but since you don't need the ask/tell business, it's best to not think of it that way.  In this second mode, you can control the colors in a basic fashion.  So, I use the clumsy syntax thing for color, and smarthome for on/off.  If you want to do more specific stuff, use a third party option like if-then, or use the LIFX app itself.  For me, I want it to turn on/ off or intensity the most so the skill mode is fun but not a deal breaker.  Great convenience!!!  Awesome integration.",Forget the naysayers!

All in all this was a simple and now very cool skill! Remember to change the color you have to include ""ask life-ex to..."" (change the _____ light to _____).

If you want Lifx and Alexa to get on well, it'll take a bit of time and a little effort (read a little, think about it a little, etc.). One way to make things very simple is to use IFTTT (If This, Then That) which invokes simple conditional commands (unfortunately at this point complex conditionals, e.g. If x and y, then z, are not an option, as far as I can tell). So, for example, you can set lights to a particular color (say, orange) and a particular brightness (say, 30%), then include those parameters in what Lifx calls a scene (this is all done in the Lifx app). Then you can use IFTTT to execute that scene with a simple command like ""Alexa, trigger waking up"" or whatever you wish. The point here is that the poor reviews are not reflective of limitations imposed by Lifx lights or Alexa (this is not to say there aren't limits to both and to their interaction, but that the poor reviews do not come close to reflecting those limitations). I am now able to control lights in every room of the house with voice commands to Echo. A couple of times it hasn't worked. And both times it was because I had left something out of the command (whether in Alexa, IFTTT, or Lifx). As for Echo not understanding ""Lif-eX"", this was the case until a recent update with Echo/Alexa a few weeks ago. It was frustrating, since people claimed to be able to do it. I could not. Then Amazon sent out an update to Echo/Alexa and it worked great. It works best when ""Lifx"" is articulated clearly, i.e. ""Life Ex"". In the early stages of home automation, things can, as we''d expect, be a bit tricky/buggy, and I don't mean to suggest that everything works as we would ideally like, but it's pretty cool. I can walk into my house and with a couple of voice commands turn on the stereo and TV (they're hooked together for movies), set the lights to a particular brightness and color, and change the temperature. This is better than most royalty had it in days past. So if you're looking to automate your house, this is a pretty cool setup. Yes, it'll take a little time and effort, but so will any other setup. I'm very pleased. And, no, I have no affiliation or association with either Lifx or Amazon.

For example, if you have a group called ""Mike's Room"", ""[wake word], tell Life Ex to turn the Mike's Room lights on,"" works every time but, ""[wake word], tell Life Ex to turn Mark's Room lights on,"" won't work every time.

My take: I do live in this area, but at this point, this is pretty limited. It only allows you to set a home and a destination station (one of each). You can adjust those at any time verbally, though. Communications include:

NOTE: You can do a compound communication: &ldquo;Alexa, open BART Times and&hellip;[one of the below]

* When is my next train?
* Are there any advisories?
* Are the elevators okay?
* Set my home station to [station name]

Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. The skill is pretty narrow in what it can do. Which is usually a good thing for Alexa skills. So it's relatively intuitive to use to get the information you want. If you are a regular user, you will quickly learn what you need through repetition. The only downside is the initial setup. If you don't get your station right, it drops the session. There is no option to list the known stations. A retry option would have made it much easier to deal with.

Usefulness: 2 out of 5. If you are a regular user of the BART, this will be occasionally handy. For everyone else in the world, it is completely useless. It is kind of limited to just a single home and destination. But, since the Echo doesn't move, you are always starting from the same point. Your destination might change, though, and there is no support for that. Also, this is best for commuters, who probably already know the timetable for their daily grind.

Novelty: 4 out of 5. It's a good fit for the standard Echo scenario of ""I'm sitting on my couch, drinking a beer, and I..."". It is also one of the few that employ persistence and an outside web app.

Overall: 3 out of 5. It is nicely done, but its audience is very narrow and of those it is targeting, its features provide limited scope.","Its audience is very narrow and for those it is targeting, its features provide limited scope",1449187200,,,1453

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The audio interface is usable, but there is room for improvement. It is mostly designed to be used as a one-shot invocation. You call it, get your information, and you are done. I, however, find scheduling to be a more iterative task. I want check a few times to see when I, or someone else, is free, then schedule something for it. The skill, as currently written, hangs up after each interaction. So I had to launch it several times to get through the task I set out to accomplish.

I also suspect, under the covers, that it's forgoing Alexa's precise matching for a more general, skill implemented matching. There were a number of times it didn't quite get what I wanted and behaved oddly. When I asked for help, it hung up. It misheard a request to check someone else's availability for a request to create an entry. And it didn't understand I wanted to reset it. All I could do was hang up.

But the skill actually works for calendar creation. Almost anything with free format text is going to be a disaster on Alexa, but FreeBusy has made it work. That's an achievement.

Usefulness: 4 out of 5. If you manage your life with a calendar, this is a godsend. I try to keep a firm work-life balance, but sometimes at home organizing my personal life and I'd like to check if I have time for that parent-teacher conference. Once FreeBusy connect to Lotus Notes, I'll be good!

There are areas for improvement. The functionality is minimal. But that's not unreasonable for a first release. I expect if it is popular that the ability to change, cancel, reschedule or add contacts to meetings will be added.

Novelty: 5 out of 5. I like it. ""Productivity Apps"" are a very established category in  mobile applications, but this is the first I've seen for Alexa. It adds a new dimension to the product and creates a use case for an entire new category of people. Not only that, concepts for many other productivity skills come to mind. If I can do this, why can't I check my mail, text messages, and several other daily tasks?

Overall: 4 out of 5. This is a great idea with a good foundation. It's long term success will be in how much further it is developed and what quality can be achieved within Alexa's limitations. At some point I expect that Alexa will be served up in a car, and, if FreeBusy has continued to refine this, it will be a killer app for that market.","If you manage your life with a calendar, this is a godsend",1449187200,3.0,,2582

Ease of Use: 2 out of 5. I don't own a Garageio Blackbox. So there's limited comments I can make. It's kind of ambiguous how to pronounce the invocation phrase. I pronounced it to rhyme with ""Bellagio"" and it started up fine. Then it tells you to link up your device. Help produces the same. Linking is done via a URL on the card, as opposed to using the new account linking feature. Perhaps it is nifty and slick once you have it linked up. I'm a little dubious given the shallow integration elsewhere.

Usefulness: 1 out of 5. I have a garage. I have a garage door opener. I'm familiar with it's use. I cannot think of any conceivable reason that I'd want to operate my garage door while sitting on my couch. Maybe there's a huge use case I'm missing. But I can't see the point of it.

Novelty: 2 out of 5. OK, certainly no one has done this before. But plenty of people have hooked up arbitrary home automation devices to the Echo. Most of those had more purpose than this. There may be functionality I'm missing, but this skill doesn't make good use of the features that are there, let alone introduce any new ones.

Overall: 1 out of 5. For all intents and purposes this appears to have been done just so they could add another line to their supported devices.

It just goes to show that cats really do get everyone on the Internet. So why not on The Echo?

Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. You ask it for a fact about cats, it tells you one. It doesn't get simpler than that. There isn't much to it, but there doesn't need to be. (Asking it to say ""Meow"" is a nice touch, though.)

That said, I did run into some issues that I wish the garageio installation instructions made clearer.  A summary of my installation experience, and first impressions:

First, when installing the garage door control wires to your opener, make sure you have it unplugged.  I didn't, and almost fell off my ladder when my garage door started opening as I was trying to attach the opener cable.

Second, and this may be just me with fat fingers, but I had a rather difficult time trying to peel the adhesives off the various wire clamps, activators and sensors.  I probably spent more time trying to peel away the backing than actually installing the cables.

Third, while the garageio instructions have you check position of the activator, also check the sensor, which the instructions didn't mention to check.  I didn't and ended up having the rigid weather strip at the bottom of my garage door knock the sensor ajar.  Also, the garageio instructions note that you should have the sensor/activator no more than 0.5"" apart.  For one of my doors, unfortunately, I'm at almost 1"" but it still ended up working properly.

Fourth, once installed, everything was working, but I did notice that the web page and mobile app don't refresh status automatically when to operate a door by other means.  So if you use the door button, your original remote, IFTTT or even Alexa to trigger your door, you won't get an automatic web / browser refresh.

Finally, and specifically relating to using garageio with Alexa:  I had to do some trial-and-error to figure out what Alexa would recognize accurately and consistently.  The rub here is that, at least as of this writing, you have to disable / reenable the Alexa garageio skill each time you update a door name.  If you got Alexa to recognize the door names on the 1st go, consider yourself lucky.  If Alexa doesn't recognize your door names, and you have multiple doors ... this part of the set-up can get tedious quickly.","Works well, but some minor usability/installation issues.",1471478400,3.0,,2100

It's not perfect, though, and I don't get the sense that the Garageio manufacturer is incrementally enhancing this skill - I fear that's it's as good as its going to get.

Issue #1

Each garage door is given a name.  I have one with my name and one with my wife's name.  Our names are both single syllable, but start with different letters and have completely different phenomes.

Me: Alexa, ask garageio to close Dean's door.
Echo: Closing Mary's door.
Me:  What the heck?!?

It happens all the time, even when standing right next to the Echo.  Sure, I could rename the doors to something that the Echo can distinguish between, but it shouldn't be necessary.  I recognize that this is likely an Amazon thing and not a Garageio thing, but the fact that Echo sits in my house and can't distinguish between the spoken names of two residents in the home is kinda sad.

Issue #2

We have three garage doors and a 3 door Garageio black box.  What doesn't work:

""Alexa, ask Garageio if any doors are open""
""Alexa, ask Garageio to close all doors""

""Alexa, ask Garageio if Dean's door is open""
""Alexa, ask Garageio if Mary's door is open""
""Alexa, ask Garageio to close Mary's door""

You can't ask Garageio if any doors are open, not can you ask it to close all doors.  You have to ask it about the status of each door in turn.  It's much faster to just open the garageio app and scroll through the door status pages or just walk outside and look at the garage.  Some simple multi-door commands would substantially improve the utility here.

Issue #3 (a nitpick, but hey, that's what reviews are for!)

Launching skills on Echo already isn't super smooth - ""Alexa, ask Garageio to open Dean's door"".  The fact that one must pronounce ""garageio"" in each request is a bit cumbersome, as the name doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  I'd love it if I could nickname a skill.  ""Alexa, ask Bob to close Dean's door"" would be a small but welcome improvement.

Overall, a fun toy, but I find that because of Issues #1 and #2, we never actually use Garageio on the Echo, even though it would be totally awesome to do so.","I want to love this so much, but it needs work",1450310400,18.0,,2226

There are a number of twists on the genre that make this game stand out- first being that there is only a single large game world rather than a personal game for everyone. Everything is in real time- the attacks you make occur immediately and the unit production occurs 24/7. This is balanced by ""tides""- certain routes between planets are available all the time while others are only navigable for short windows. This can keep you safe from attack or strand you far from home. With careful management you can build up your side but carelessness will leave you lost in space.

This game takes advantage of the medium, placing you in command of a ship and having Alexa take the role of the ship's computer. There is an extensive set of prompts that will guide you through the game, as well as a help function. I found that the combination makes for an immersive game experience, although I would recommend taking some notes or drawing your own star maps, since the large game world can be daunting.

Category: game
My take: This does a nice job with calling Bingo for you. You can print free Bingo cards from the LME site above. I did test it by calling Bingo before I could possibly have gotten one, and it gently corrected me. You can also say, &ldquo;Help&rdquo;: that&rsquo;s a great feature! This does very much what you would like it to do, with good interactions and smooth error handling.
Communications include:

NOTE: You can do a compound communication: &ldquo;Alexa, open Bingo and&hellip;[one of the below]

* Start
* Next (number)
* Help
* Bingo!
* End game

App ability? The called numbers appear in your app.

Note: I am not associated with this skill except as a user, although I have had some correspondence with the developer",Bingo! Well written app brings the bingo hall to your family room,1451001600,4.0,,773
4,False,"12 4, 2015",A1O35FYKDTF5Z9,B017OBN1FI,jjaquinta,"This is another skill from LME, who brought you Crystal Ball last week. This one is a little more to it.

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The user interface for the game is pretty straightforward. It's easy to learn, but there are a few detracting points. Games can go on for quite a while. An actual bingo caller mixes it up a bit in how they tell you the number and column. This skill doesn't, and since the tone can't change, it gets a little monotonous. The other problem is that, although it's pretty good at recognition, you end up saying ""next"" enough times that it eventually gets it wrong. After that, it's game over. There's no way to restart a game. Same thing happens if the skill crashes in the middle, or you are pulled away for a moment. That last quibble is that the text on the card is clearly the same text that gets read out. You can tell because it is punctuated to put in pauses for the speech synthesis. It would have been a nice touch if the card text was formatted for reading.

Usefulness: 4 out of 5. If you like Bingo, then it's great. If you don't, you needn't bother. I can see you keeping a table of a few kids of exactly the right age entertained with this for a while. But it's a little hard. Any chatter is going to confuse Alexa and reset the game. But, for the right age, that just adds to the gameplay.

Novelty: 3 out of 5. It is an interesting enough idea. In my search for simple games that work for the Echo, I never thought of this. The execution is straightforward though. No particularly nifty lessons to take home and apply to your own skills.

Overall: 4 out of 5. Bingo is a solid player app for The Echo. If you like it, you'll probably use it a lot. If you don't, you won't.","If you like Bingo, then it's great. If you don't, you needn't bother",1449187200,,,1715

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The basics are there, but there are a few rough edges that would have been nice to have been filed off. Unlike the weather skill, Tide Pooler doesn't remember you, so you need to tell it your city each time. The city choice is actually quite limited and the list is rather long to sit and listen too.

Usefulness: 2 out of 5. The number of cities served is quite limited. And the number of people who really want to know tide is even more limited. So I can't see this becoming a break out skill. Also, how do you have a low tide of ""-1 feet""?

Novelty: 2 out of 5. The Echo comes out of the box with a bunch of look-up functionality. Not being a follower of sports, I use it all the time to find out if the Red Sox won so I know if the local restaurant is offering free kid's meals.  But the built in skills do a better job than this one. There are plenty of use cases for look-up skills. Following the design of the built in ones would be better than following this one. And choosing something less marginal than tides would also be good.

But, if you are genuinely seeking to build inner awareness and build meditation into your schedule, I can see it handy to be able to call out from your lotus position on Alexa for guidance, rather than flipping through a book or computer screen.

Novelty: 4 out of 5. This isn't terribly different from LME's Crystal Ball skill, nor what I anticipate their upcoming ""Angry Bard"" skill will be like.

3,False,"12 4, 2015",A1O35FYKDTF5Z9,B017OBNE6O,jjaquinta,"This skill is a very simple game with a nice twist that you can either think of a number or guess a number.

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. The skill, as designed, is pretty straightforward and easy to use. When Alexa is doing to guessing, it doesn't really seem to pay very much attention to what you say. ""no"" was recognized correctly, but interpreted by the game as ""higher"" and ""fishwife"" was interpreted as ""that's the right answer"". O_o Looks like the utterances used a generic slot, and the skill is trying to do its on NLP. Better to stick to what Amazon gives you.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. A moderately interesting game, but it gets old quickly. The design assumes that Alexa is a perfect transcriber of speech to text. The average game is going to be 7 turns long. To be perfect 95% of the time, Alexa would have to have an accuracy of of 99.38%. It doesn't. This kind of throws a wrench in the gameplay when, through no fault of your own, the game goes off kilter because of a mis-heard response.

Novelty: 3 out of 5. There are lots of puzzles out there. There must be more compelling ones that this that play to Alexa's strengths, rather than its weaknesses.

Overall: 3 out of 5. It's a fine demo skill. Will look great at the podium at a conference. But I can't see there being a lot of adoption for it.",It's a fine demo skill. Will look great at the podium at a conference. But I can't see there being a lot of adoption for it,1449187200,,,1312

You either love cats or not. This is a cat fact finder for cat lovers, so get over it or move on. This  cat fact is very informative. Out of the 10 facts I requested, I did not know 8 of them. I consider myself quite cat oriented with a daughter in law who is a veterinarian and loves to talk shop. The cat facts are quite unique and would be a perfect category for the family. Children love to learn and introducing them to this feature will be a good thing for them, indeed. The entire family can listen, and then discuss the fact.

This is a simple category that anyone can use. If your child understands the Alexa Amazon Echo, this can be a great learning tool. It will also teach them to be precise, because Alexa will only answer specific categories.

Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. As with all ""fortune cookie"" skills, the interface is minimalist. Hard to go wrong. The only real improvement that could be made is for a slight pause between the insult, and the reference. I know this skill has been waiting in the queue for a while. Back when it was written, you couldn't add in  a pause. So hopefully it will be in the next revision.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This is kind of fun. I like the concept, but Alexa's pronunciation of Elizabethan English makes it a little hard to savor the biting wit of English's most famous playwright. But, unlike most skill, I'll probably keep this one enabled.

Novelty: 3 out of 5. Fortune cookie skills are pretty plentiful. And there really isn't a lot of scope to grow this one much. But it's a cut above, say, Edgar Facts. (Well, honestly, what wouldn't be?)

Overall: 4 out of 5. It's nice to see something a little more classical out there. The anachronism of listening to 400 year old prose spoken by cutting edge software is worth the price alone!

Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. They've picked an excellent target. It fits perfectly into the canonical ""I'm sitting at home on my couch, drinking a beer, and I want to..."" use case. It's narrowly focused, so you just get what you want. The potential weak point would be recognizing your city name, but it worked for the few cities I tried. It might not work as well if you live in a smaller or harder to pronounce town. (But it did recognize Port au Prince!) The event listings are a little long, but not long enough to get tedious. You can scroll through them easily enough, but it appears to lack a mechanism for backing up, skipping forward, or replaying a single event.
Usefulness: 4 out of 5. It is great at what it does, and what it does is time dependent, so I can see coming back to this regularly. The information is relevant and pertinent, but if you find something you like, you still have to get off of the couch and go to the computer. It would be nice if the cards displayed in the companion app contained additional information, or a link to their web site. Yes, you can't put clickable links in the cards yet, but it would be a lot easier to cut and paste than to search from scratch.
Novelty: 4 out of 5. This is a great idea and leverages their web site well. Any other event based web site would be well advised to follow their model. The fact that Alexa does not support ""push notification"" has probably put off the likes of eVite, but StubHub has shown that you can still do a lot without that.
Overall: 4 out of 5. It is great for what it does, and has scope for being even better. Being able to scroll events selectively would be good. Being able to filter events (e.g. concerts, sports) would make it a little more targeted. Using the reprompt for discovery of additional features would be a great way to add these without impacting the usability of the interface.
Another improvement would be making it more adaptable.

4,False,"12 4, 2015",A1O35FYKDTF5Z9,B017OBYNZU,jjaquinta,"Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. The entire skill is implemented with only taking ""yes"" and ""no"" for an answer. A pretty good achievement. I also like that it occasionally interjects a non-gameplay comment like ""Hmm. What could it be."" It makes the interface more personable.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. It's pretty simplistic. And some questions don't easily have a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. I'm familiar with the general game as one of the first old text-based games to demonstrate machine learning. However, unlike those implementations, this doesn't actually have the capacity to learn new animals. Given Alexa's difficulty with accepting free form text, it's understandable.

Novelty: 4 out of 5. The game isn't new, but it is a very clever use of Alexa's strengths, but avoiding its weaknesses. It was written by an Amazonian, they may have been watching in frustration at the fairly simple skills being done and took matters into their own hands.

Overall: 4 out of 5. It's a good skill, and I'll probably keep it enabled for a while. It's a hit with my kids.

3,False,"12 4, 2015",A1O35FYKDTF5Z9,B017OBSCOS,jjaquinta,"Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. This game itself is pretty simple. It introduces you well to the gameplay. It is, however, hung up on the general failing that Alexa's Speech To Text is not 100% perfect. In any game of more than a few moves, it is going to get something wrong. In some cases, it's handy that it recognizes something, although not the word you spoke. In others, it's frustrating as it refuses to recognize an actual word.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. It's not a bad game, although I wouldn't go so far as to say ""Playing with words was never so much fun"". The scoring system is severely broken. The scores did not advance with the length of each word. Rather they seemed to oscillate around the 80 to 90 mark.

Novelty: 4 out of 5. The short interactions imposed by Alexa works well for this style of game. I'm glad to see something that is a bit less trivial than ""guess the number"". I'm still waiting for a game that blends complex game play with a simple interface. Something to give my upcoming Starlanes skill a run for its money.

Ease of Use: 5 out of 5. The skill is very simple to use. All you do is repeat numbers to it. I tried messing with it by using negative numbers or decimals, but it caught it. It even passed the ""fishwife"" test. It's hard to go wrong.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This is mostly a demonstration game. It really isn't engaging enough for a lot of repeat play (unless you are a certain age).

Novelty: 2 out of 5. I've been assuming Amazon has not released my ""Knock Knock"" joke skill because they already have similar functionality. But here they've released a skill nearly identical to another one. That and this being the third number game there rates it low for novelty.

Overall: 4 out of 5. Although having less features than ""Higher or Lower"", it plays better because it is more focused. It also rates higher than ""Math Puzzles"" by being actually playable. I would like to see a future version where the responses are a bit more varied. Slightly different phrases for ""too high"" and ""too low"" would improve engagement. Giving hints like ""Oh, so close!

I do want to say that the game automatically matches your vocabulary level. If you are using more complex words it will do the same.  The frustration is that it has a great deal of trouble representing endings like ""ly"" ""ed"" ""ant"" ""ing"" and ""late"". It uses words with these extenders including a lot of ""s"" but it doesn't hear the ones the user enters sometimes.  For example, it hears functionary as function or librarian as library. It sometimes does not recognize a word but it has to have limitations. It is fun to play anyway but very irritating sometimes when it cuts off your word and therefore your score.  Better hearing would make this game a five.  You can play long words but you have to recognize what it will hear and what it won't. It can hear houndstooth but shortens cantilever to candle or glassblower glass or lower.

Given that's the market I think Amazon's is aiming for, that's significant. Also, unlike every other skill so far (other than StubHub) this one has a chance of paying for its own development!

Ease of Use: 4 out of 5. I do not have a Scout Alarm, so I can't review all aspects of this. But what functionality that is there is well done. I'm glad to see someone tying a skill into an external website. Given what I can see of the Alexa half, it looks to be well done. A poster child for what I recommend in my book!

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. Obviously it isn't very useful if you have a Scout Alarm. But even if you do, it seems like there are few times that you are going to want to turn it on or off, or check if it has gone off, while already at home.

Novelty: 3 out of 5. Not a bad fit for an Echo, but not a particularly good fit either.  If this system could grow into something with more fidelity that would be nice. Instead of just tripping an alarm, it could alert you when motion was detected, or something short of a full scale alarm. Then there would be more scenarios where you might want to access the data from your couch.

Overall: 3 out of 5. Scout Alarms looks like they are aiming to be the ""Cadillac"" of their market. As such, this adds a feature that differentiates them from their competitors. Looking at the skill on its own, its audience is narrow and of those it is targeting, its features provide limited scope.

Usefulness: 2 out of 5. Since you can't open it, it's completely useless. But, even if you could, from the description this is going to be a lot less useful than they make it out to be. Alexa is only marketed for speaking English, and as we saw with ""Translator for Alexa"", it's actually really hard to get it to say foreign words. So you can immediately throw out those 870 languages variants. Similarly, older versions like the King James, have too many archaic words in them to avoid glitches. Lastly, the one thing that computers really suck at reading is poetry. And so much of of any holy book is about the meter and pacing of the prose. I can't see it being compelling.

Novelty: 2 out of 5. I did think of this concept. But I held back because the translations with more modern words that would be spoken well are owned by people and I would need permission. They seem to already have that, so it's a bit of a shame they did it so badly.

Overall: 1 out of 5. This has the appearance of being done solely so they can say they have done it, and to drive business to their mobile apps.

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. As with any skill using a linked account, this is a little tricky to negotiate. It took me a few times and some puzzlement to work it out. I was a little leery giving it several contact methods for many people. I looked at the terms and conditions but they were typically long and cryptic. There was no clear statement that I could easily see saying that my info was not being sold. I blanked out my information after reviewing, but there was no way to delete your account.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. If you are buying an echo for an elderly relative, there can be some advantage to this app. It works well for the ""I've fallen and can't get up"" scenario. But not so well for just about any other scenario. Maybe when there are more Alexa devices out there and you can use this from your smartphone or car, there will be more use.

It's also great if you want to spam or harass someone.

Novelty: 4 out of 5. There have been one or two calendar integration apps. But this is the first general alert one. I'm happy to see that it sends fixed messages, instead of attempting low quality free format text. As a sender of canned messages go, this could be useful for a variety of things. Say if the web end could be connected up to IFTTT.

Overall: 2 out of 5. I cannot, in good conscience, give this a rating based solely on quality. Up until a few months ago I was an Ethical Hacker, and got a very firm schooling in security and privacy. You can use this skill to set up several contacts with a variety of contact methods and then effortlessly blast out a message to them as often as you like. There is no opt-in. The only way the sender is identified is how they choose to be identified. There's no way, as a recipient, to stop the messages. Sure, if used as intended, it is beneficial.

Let the family members and friends you list as emergency contacts know that you've put them down to receive a text or voice call if you have an emergency.

While it isn't a factor on the Alexa app, I have to say that the development team is excellent.

They have followed up twice with me checking if I have questions on either device. You don't usually get service this good for paid apps!

I have two conditions that make me prone to falls, but neither one is severe enough for my insurer to pay for a traditional emergency button. Although Ask My Buddy isn't the same as a  911 service, it does take some of the fear away from my being alone. Especially at night when I am tired and most afraid to fall.

constantly, lots of static and it ate electricity. I finally gave up and ended the service. NOW I have this. With two Echoes in my home I am always within voice range of Alexa! On a trial run, within 30 seconds, my hubby's cell phone rang with information that I needed help. I have him set as a voice answer on his cell phone and two others set to receive texts because that is what they use most often. Now everyone is happy because I can get immediate help.

Extremely unhappy.  My elderly mother bought an Echo just for this service, and was led to believe it was free and it is not free.  The info, as we were in the process of signing her up, stated that if she couldn't afford to pay, that she could sign up for free, however there was absolutely no way possible to do this.  The fine print then goes on to reveal that they are a volunteer-based service and please be 'kind'.  They also discourage leaving bad reviews!  I'm sorry, but I think others should know about this false advertising. If I can help one person from buying an Echo just for this service (by being misled) then my time was worth it.  My anger here lies with the 'Ask My Buddy' folks for shamefully misleading an elderly woman.  I do love Amazon and my own Echo, but I'm wondering if Amazon has any fault here.  Surely I cannot be the only customer with this issue.  I think they should advertise ahead of time that you must pay a fee every three months for the service.  Why hide this fact?  Give people a choice before they shell out money for the Echo.  Just seems shady and I don't like it at all.
 Also of note, the Ask My Buddy website (wwwaskmybuddy.net) has no mention of a fee anywhere on the page. As a matter of fact, it falsely states that ""Ask My Buddy is a free service that leverages Amazons Alexa Voice Platform to connect a user to their Personal Alert  Network using only their voice. The service is designed for ease of use by all customers, and is a favorite of senior and mobility challenged individuals. Ask My Buddy is not a substitute for 911, but rather an additional tool for those trying to preserve their independence, offering the security of knowing help is just a shout away"".

Then, after you say ""ready"" it counts down in a manner that takes more than 5 seconds. Often, it fails to understand ""ready"".

Pros:
Customizable, linking between remotes, backup system, alexa integration, has kodi remote, able to send network get commands which allowed me to port in voxcommando for more advanced playlists and control,
Cons:
Restores only work on devices of similar size and Color goes back to default, lack of reorganization when macros are built, after restore can't edit the network commands which worries me if the IP address changes since voxcommando voice commands have specific address, scheduling macros never works I have tricked the iPad by recording the voice commands and using Aida reminder app to schedule recordings at times I want my gear to trigger would rather a real time solution within the app.

Conclusion: even with a few flaws this system impressed me enough to undo my windows controller tablet, swap to an iPad use anymote its nice that any iOS app could replace it if something happened and this is the only app/ skill that doesn't require using something like AWS and tons of leg work to be up and running .

2,False,"01 8, 2016",A3F25W8YQE5NGE,B018YICXQS,E. Wrye,"THIS IS A REVIEW SPECIFICALLY OF USING IT WITH AMAZON ECHO VOICE CONTROL ONLY: In its current state this is more of a novelty than a practical application. First off, the long phrase you must speak to initiate an action makes you feel kinda stupid when pushing one button could accomplish the same thing. Secondly, rather than sending the whole phrase over to Anymote then having Anymote parse the command words and figure out what you want, this had the Echo do the parsing and just send what it THINKS the command is over to the remote it THINKS you said. This not only requires you to choose super simple limited one word device names but the Echo doesn't understand many command words that it would have no problem understanding in other context. Also, Echo has an issue with compound words or phrases and will most often only send one word. Examples: ""Tell Anymote to Volume up 5 times my receiver"" ALWAYS makes echo only send volume up so Anymote volumes up once. ""Tell Anymote to Initiate my Samsung"" where ""initiate"" is a button you created for a macro to turn on your entertainment system results in echo either telling you it doesn't understand the command or giving you an example of what you can say with Anymote. Many words result in this - I went through 4 or 5 words renaming the button before finally finding one that echo would properly send over to Anymote. ""Tell Anymote to Movie Mode my Receiver"" will 3 out of 4 times cause echo to send only ""movie"" and not ""movie mode"" - this is typical with all compound words or any command phrase more than one word - echo will most often only send one word. Overall, this doesn't work well enough or reliably enough to be used for anything other than a novelty or something to play around with for kicks and giggles. Hopefully the developers will come up with simpler phrasing for the command and also just have echo send the entire command over and have their app parse the words and figure out what to do (hopefully with better algorithms). I know this would require way more programming but would add significant value to the Anymote app.",ECHO Review: More Novelty than Usefulness Now,1452211200,16.0,,2101
3,False,"01 2, 2016",A1STBD7R3SS1E8,B018YICXQS,Jeff S.,"To those that are having any issues: I promise you this works as you would want and expect. If you have any questions, they have great help at colortigerapps@gmail.com. Just e-mail them.

But here's a few tricks I've found.
1: Alexa wants to hear commands in a certain way. The most important thing is to use the following syntax:
""Alexa: Tell Anymote TO xxx MY yyy""
Where xxx is the remote control button name, and yyy is the remote name.
The words TO and MY are VERY important.

2: Alexa is learning new words everyday. But just as Alexa sometimes doesn't catch what you say just right under normal circumstances, the same can be true using this skill. For example, I have an A/V switcher with buttons normally named A1..A2..A3..B1..B2 etc. But Alexa doesn't understand those as words and will send Command ""undefined."" to the app. But in the Anymote app. you can rename any button name - just click on the pencil edit icon for your remote, click on EDIT, highlight the button you want to rename, and click on tT (text) in the upper left. This will show you the DEFAULT button name. This is what you must use in your command to Alexa (""xxx"" in my first trick above) - but you can change it. So in my example, change A1 to DVR and you will see the command is translated and will work properly.

*** When first starting out you should use the edit feature in the app. to see EXACTLY what the buttons names are, and say them to Alexa just as they are shown in my TIP # 1 above.

3: Just because a command is translated and shows up on your smart device doesn't mean it will work unless the button name and remote name are translated exactly correct. So Alexa will translate to your smart device Received voice command ""volume up"" for remote ""Television"" - but if your button is not named ""Volume UP"" it won't do anything. Likewise if you don't have a remote named ""Television"".

So in short, name your remote and button names (which you can change in the app.) with words Alexa will always translate properly and you will solve 99% of the issues.

The really neat thing is the app doesn't have to be launched on your smart device. If you have an Anymote Home (which I HIGHLY recommend, available on Amazon) IR blaster/recorder, just make sure bluetooth is turned on (you DO NOT need to connect bluetooth, that happens automatically).
And make sure you have WIFI or a network connection to your Amazon Echo.

With the well over 1,250,000 remote device configurations available in the app. and easy to match to your devices, and the record capability for just about any remote you have, you'll be able to control just about anything with Alexa voice commands with this skill.","The same post as below, but with HTML removed for easier viewing!",1451692800,10.0,,2672

I tend to use Alexa though IFTTT because it seems more direct for events, To turn on my TV system, I can say ""Alexa, trigger t v on"". For the Skill set I need to say "" Alexa, tell HomeSeer to run the T V on event"". The actual event name is ""TV on"" so I would also have to rename it to ""T V on"". The second issue is my naming of my devices. For example, I have a device called (room, floor, name) ""1st Floor Jeanette's Room Dresser Light Near Door Node 11"", well that is not going to work. First off, I must change all of my ""1st Floor""s to ""First Floor"" and everything else needs to change so that the command could be "" Alexa, tell HomeSeer to turn on the Desk Lamp in the girls room on the first floor"".

The positives are that it can be done (if you can remember the long phrases and rename everything) and that it responds fast. IFTTT sometimes (but rarely) is slow to respond. I wish HomeSeer would make the event Event command so I could just tailor my Events to easy sayings. Like ""Alexa, HomeSeer T V off"" and forget this ""Alexa, tell Homeseer to run event T V on"" stuff. Maybe someone can create a Skill set just for HS Events that can use the key word of ""Run"" so I can just say ""Alexa, Run T V On"".

4,False,"02 4, 2018",AUUFW7PTUHLT,B019DB6YNI,MamaSylvia,"This seems to be the best of the available stopwatch skills, which sadly isn't saying much. I really waffled about whether to give it 3 or 4 stars, and finally decided on 4 because I'll only have to remember 2 commands - launch and stop - and it will let me play music at the same time. That is what I need a stopwatch skill for.

- There is a lot of variation in the command format. For example, ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, start stopwatch"" starts a new stopwatch if one isn't already running - otherwise it gives you the status of the one running. But ""Alexa, status stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, stopwatch status"" doesn't work. ""Alexa, stop stopwatch"" also produces the status but does NOT stop the stopwatch. You have to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to stop"" to actually end it. Is it really necessary to use such a roundabout format?

- For actually using it, pretty much count on having to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to"" (pause, resume, stop). The simpler ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" will start it or give you the status.

- As others have said, this isn't a precision function. I just want to time how long I can pedal on the exercise bike, so a few seconds' variation won't make a difference to me. But if seconds matter to you, there isn't an Alexa skill that will meet your needs.

You can&rsquo;t understand half the clues without reading them in the app.

Alexa can frequently mishear things, but sometimes she hears just fine and you get it wrong because you said &ldquo;the&rdquo; or &ldquo;a&rdquo; before the noun answer. Someone else mentioned not including a middle name.  Exactly.

If you play frequently, you will hear the same clues over and over in different formats.

Disney started work on this adaptation of a Hans Christian Anderson story in 1937.
The movie Frozen is based on The Snow Queen from this author.  That&rsquo;s just one example. It&rsquo;s annoying.

What some don't know is that if you are stuck playing using a Dot, you can follow along with the Alexa app opened to see the questions instead of just hearing them.  Some clues must be seen, especially with Alexa's ongoing pronunciation and cadence issues when attempting to speak ""normally"".

What drives me crazy is that if you get a question wrong, Alexa will ask if you're ready for the next question.  If you get it right, she just gives you the next question.  I don't understand this design choice nor why it's so frustrating, but there you have it and there you are.  What I'm hearing is ""Oh, you got it wrong...do you need a minute to collect yourself before I ask another question, you poor thing?""  Why would someone say ""No?"" They get the question wrong and...quit playing for the day?  The logic escapes me entirely.

Sometimes Alexa talks, sometimes Alex talks.  The two voices back and forth are weird and could be integrated with one another better.  Obviously, the more Alex Trebek and the less Alexa you can get is better as it helps one suspend their disbelief.  If future versions included him asking the questions instead of Alexa, it would be perfect.

This is a bigger gripe as Alexa does this no matter what skill you're using, but when she says ""You can say common phrases such as 'who is' or 'what is'..."" it should be limited to once per day.

1) Alexa's pronunciation on some words, particularly words with foreign origins is pretty awful.  It helps to have the app open so that you can read along.

2) I am a native English speaker with a fairly ""normal,"" voice.  At least once a week, Alexa will mishear my answer and give me the buzzer!!  Makes me cranky.

I'm downgrading my review from 4 stars to 2 stars.  For some reason, I can only play the first 6 questions as of this morning.  When prompted to get the Double Jeopardy round, I am returned to the original 6 questions.  Bad quality control.

3,False,"07 29, 2018",ANPKCF82DDN9Z,B019G0M2WS,Justine,"Overall, the Jeopardy skill is fun, especially if you are a fan of the game show. However, there are a few issues that diminish the fun. First, Alexa can often be difficult to understand when reading complex clues. No matter how many times she repeats the clue, she is sometimes indecipherable. However, you can read the clue while the robot is reading aloud by having the app open to the homepage. That basically solves the problem. A second issue is that Alexa often has trouble understanding me. She frequently tells me to answer in the form of a question, even though I have done so. Also, she will sometimes count my answer wrong, even when I have given the correct answer. This is very frustrating and causes me to swear profusely at Alexa. A third issue has to do with making up a day of clues. If you did not complete the questions for each day of the week, you can make them up another day. Alex Trebek comes on and asks if you want to be play the days you missed. You then say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Next, he asks if you&rsquo;re ready to start, and you say &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; But for some reason that is not an appropriate answer, and he tells you to say &ldquo;start.&rdquo; But when you say &ldquo;start,&rdquo; then the whole annoying spiel starts over. Again, this is very frustrating and results in profuse swearing. Ultimately, the skill is really frustrating at times. However, I really like Jeopardy, so I will keep playing.",Fun but Frustrating!,1532822400,,,1439

The first note of each quiz always seems to be a C, presumably to be used as a reference pitch which defeats the purpose of perfect pitch training. The notes also seem to only cover one octave. Even though the order of notes seems to be random, there are many notes that are repeated several times in a row, and in the short time I experimented with the app I never received an F note to identify. The app also seems to have trouble distinguishing the spoken responses that sound alike, B, C, D, E, G.  That said, the quiz structure itself is well implemented, and the praise for correct answers is cute and fun.

I think there is another simpleton in this skill.  This is a very primitive skill.  This same reviewer called it a 'stupid pet trick'.  That is very apt.  Here is my take for what it's worth.

Good: you can make it call a contact; Bad: that contact has to have a simple name.  I haven't tried it out fully enough to figure out if it will take more than one word.  It didn't recognize our favorite pizza place last night, and the name is two words, but I had just added the contact so I don't know yet if the issue was the name or trying to use a contact that I just added.

Good: you can listen to voice mail; Bad: you can ONLY listen to new messages and if you speak it stops and skips to next message with no way to return to the previous message.  There is no delete, a poor man's skip, and no way to navigate messages.  In short the VM listen is almost, but not quite completely useless.  ""A stupid pet trick"".

Another good feature that I have not tried yet is call a number.  However, I have not been impressed with Alexa's accuracy will long strings of digits.  It took about 20 tries to get the Weather Underground key to take, so I am not sure how will this would work, but 911 is a short string so I am hopeful that that would work.

It's loaded with information that could overwhelm, but it's designed so everything is easy to find. It's a fantastic app!

The AccuWeather Echo skill, however, is a huge disappointment. I know the information is there in the AccuWeather computers, but there is no way to get at it via the Echo voice command set. No matter what I ask (long-range, 5-day, 7-day, etc.) it simply repeats the information for today's weather, then stops. (Oh, yeah... one time I asked for the weekend weather and got sketchy info for one day of the weekend... Hey designers: A weekend has at least two days in it!!)  The only value it has for me is that it provides the AccuWeather Real Feel value when giving the current weather. That can be helpful and is an AccuWeather-only thing.

Here's how our start:  First you need to set your location by clearly pronouncing your city and state.  Note: if you haven't yet taught your device how to recognize your particular speech patterns yet, I highly recommend you do the word lists in the App. This helps her understand your speech - also don't forget to use the app to confirm, or not, that she understood you.

Second, this app can't tell you the weather, it can only give you weather alerts, sunrise and sunsets, and phases of the moon.  If you ask for the weather, Alexa will tell you that you need to EXIT the app, then ask again so her regular software can give it.

I think the developers missed on this one, a big miss.  Why?  Echo already knows your location (you should have set it up in the App when you registered your Echo), so why do we need to set it again?  Why can't it give the weather report?  That just doesn't make any sense.

Prior to this date, I had given my blessing for the layout on my roof which took a bit of time since the rafters of the roof are going in a different direction than other houses. I live in an old house so why this problem is new for Vivint is a bit strange but let's move on. The design engineers come up with a design based on photos and the roof being physically inspected. The installers come out on 3/29/18 & installed the panels. I ask as they were wrapping up if everything went well & of course, I was told that it was great & all I needed now was to get the city inspection followed by the electric company. I was ok with that info as that was what the sales person told me so I sign my name to the 'dotted line'. A coworker who has said panels told me that the city would be out within a week for the inspection & they would contact me. It would take all of 15 minutes. I left the gate unlocked & the small door to the garage unlocked for a couple of weeks thinking that gee, maybe I wouldn't have to take time off work if all they had to do was look at the electric panel & go into the back yard for panel/roof observation. After a fortnight, I began locking the doors and calls to Vivint began. I have been provided with a variety of excuses as to why the solar panels are still not working. I have been told Im in permit review, I need a contractor to correct an area around a fan, contractor bids are being accepted until 4/26, I need to call the city myself for an inspection, the panels were not installed as per our agreement and a design team needs to meet to talk about it, etc. I have requested multiple times to be provided with the same story and no one at Vivint will do that. Two days ago, I get a text from Rachel asking me what day I wanted the city to come out. When I texted back that I was waiting on a contractor, she said she forgot and that would happen after the inspection. I contacted Vivint about this and Stacy emailed that I am to continue waiting on a contractor even through the bidding was up 4/26. I have also been told that Vivint has 90 days to get the panels working so I really can't say anything. Some lady from Executive Resolution had the balls to tell me I didn't HAVE a problem. Yes, I do have a problem when a bunch of people from the same company give me the runaround and can't make up their 'collective minds' which lie I am to be told on a certain date. .

3,False,"06 21, 2016",ARV8GJTUAHU8I,B01A6ACVD2,Michael S Suter,"I've been using the Vivint Alexa application for quite some time now and I've read though quite a few of the previous reviews. I wanted to give this application 3.5 stars; however that was not an option so it only gets three.  There application is very easy to use and is stable most of the time. The ease of use and stability lands it a solid three stars to start.  That said, what keeps this app from four / five stars are the major pitfalls that the Vivint programming team has failed to recognize .

One of the pitfalls is the ability to set 'Groups'. Grouping of Z-Wave devices is common in nearly every Z-Wave interface except for Vivint. As an example, it would be nice to tell Alexa to set a specific group of lights to XX%. Currently, Vivint does not have any support for grouping. You can link devices together but this does not work to suite the over all ease of use. I have two lights in my living room linked together so when I turn one on, the other turns on as well. This is nice but If I want to dim them, I have to dim them both individually. This is where grouping would be very handy.

Another pitfall for the Vivint Alexia application is the ability to control similar named items. If you have two devices 'Livingroom Light' and 'Livingroom Lamp' the application often only recognizes the first device that was programmed in.  I've reviewed the feedback in my Alexa profile to verify it heard the correct command and it clearly did. I'm not sure if this is an issues with the Panel, the App, or the Apps ability to send commands via the web interface.

Lastly, to those who do not like having to say 'Alexa, tell Vivint....' I would not recommend basing your reviews on this criteria alone. As an Alexa programmer myself, this is simply the way Alexa works. By stating ""Alexa, tell Vivint"" or ""Alexa, ask Vivint"", this is the command that lets the device (Alexa) known from which skill to run the following voice command.  If you use a lot of Z-Wave devices and this is the biggest hang-up I would highly recommend removing your devices from the Vivint panel and putting them straight on the Echo so you may control them without having to ask Vivint via voice. There is a price to pay in doing this through. By moving your devices from the Vivint panel to the Echo you will lose Vivint's ability to control the devices via their mobile application.",Good... but.. missing features!,1466467200,38.0,,2368

This is great when it works, but there is some bug where it will not recognize one of your devices.  It seems to be related to how you name your devices.  For example, when I had a ""Living Room Lamp"" and an ""Overhead Light"", it could never 'find the Overhead Light in <my> profile'.  But the Living Room Lamp worked perfectly every time.  But when I renamed my Overhead Light to Main Light, I have no issues (so far).  Occasionally it will not understand something, but pretty rarely.  On the whole, other than that bug, it works pretty well for me.

I have 8 outlets setup with my panel that I want to voice control as well as being able to adjust thermostat, lock the door, and arm the system all via voice.  These features work great sometimes, but there seems to be some sort of bug in the Vivint interface that hits occasionally.  For example, I might say ""Alexa, ask Vivint to turn off the Downstairs light.""  One of three things will happen.  1) The echo will respond with OK, turning off your downstairs light and it shuts off.  2)  The echo will say ""I was unable to find a device named Downstairs Light in <my> profile."" 3) The echo will say ""OK turning off your garage light"" or one of the other incorrect outlets.  Now the reason I believe this is a problem on the Vivint side is because if I open the echo app, I can look at that entry and if I expand it, it says what Alexa heard and it is listed correctly that I asked for the correct outlet to be turned on or off but the response from Vivint was with the incorrect outlet.  Seems to only work correctly about half the time.  The entire reason I got all of this smart home stuff was because I eventually wanted voice control via my Echo.

We're four adults, some of whom are more susceptible to the ""but I'm starving!"" look - and the dog knows who the suckers are - so we're always asking each other if the dog has been fed yet. This app seemed like a perfect fit for us.

Alexa, ask the dog ... this part is needed because that's how Alexa works. If it's not a built-in skill, you have to tell her which app to launch. Kudos to the app developer for securing ""the dog"" as his/her app name, that part of the sentence is way more natural than ""ask my super nifty app name"".

Unfortunately the next parts of the interaction never did stick with us. The phrasing had to be just right, and wasn't anywhere close to natural for any of us. We tried having sticky notes posted for what to say. Trying to get four different people to use exactly the right phrasing proved to be too big a behavior change. This is a problem with adoption, and not necessarily the app, although some more forgiving interactions / variations would make adoption easier.

(Be careful with your phrasing, we have 3 dogs but Alexa doesn't understand if you ask ""Alexa, ask the dogs if anyone has fed them.""  She only understands if the dog is singular.)

This app would be even better if it we could customize it.  Firstly, it would just be nice to say ""Maggie just fed the dogs."" Instead of having to first ask if the dog is hungry every time.  The dogs are very good at letting us know.

The biggest argument about feeding the dogs is who did it when.  I hear a lot of ""I fed them this morning!"" or ""It's not my turn!"" You would save a lot of griping in my house if I could customize this app with each child's name.  For example, ""Alexa, ask the dog if someone has fed her.""  She would reply, ""Yes, Maggie fed the dog 2 hours ago."" Then I know that it's Kait's turn to feed the dogs tonight, or she could say ""No, Kait fed the dog 10 hours ago."" Then it's Maggie's turn.  When Alexa asks, ""Will you feed it now?"" The kid could reply, ""Yes, Maggie is feeding the dogs.""

I know a lot of the other reviewers have asked you be able to distinguish between different dogs by name.  This isn't a big deal in our house since we feed all the dogs at the same time, although one dog eats like she's starving and the other two just graze all day.  However, if you ever add a medication function, it would be essential to distinguish between different dogs and to customize medication times. For example, I have 2 dogs, Ellie gets one pill twice a day and Gleason gets one pill in the morning and 2 pills in the evening (one medicine once a day and one medicine twice a day). Even if I couldn't ask Alexa about specific medications (obviously I should know what medicine and how much each dog gets), it would be nice to ask her if the dogs got their medicine.  For example, ""Alexa, did Ellie take her medicine?"" Alexa could reply, ""Yes, Ellie took her medicine at 7AM"" or ""No, Ellie took her medicine this morning but she hasn't had any this evening"". Obviously, I would need to add each dog's name and whether they get medicine once a day, twice a day, four times a day, etc.",Great app! Would be better with some updates.,1483228800,7.0,,2309

From there website with all the same info I can order without any issues, but from Alexa I still get a generic ""invalid Payment Error"".

I think it's frustrating that once you get on a certain path or sequence in most of the adventure you can't go back to the last ""room"" or area. Often you have to finish the mini adventure before you get an option to just go back to the starting area and go from there. Another frustrating thing is there are often multiple choices for movement or actions but choosing differently only adds steps to the adventure instead of changing the outcome or location you end up on. Other than these things, which could be easily improved, I've had a great time exploring this game and hope more areas and adventures are added in the future.

3,False,"12 26, 2016",A1S1HG9ASA9MKE,B01BMUU6JQ,Mel,"Tried this out with my 7 year old son.. it's a good start, but could definitely be better:
The first choice allows you to pick from 3 paths. After that, most of the choices aren't really choices that move the story forward - mostly just keep going or go back. Later on you get more choices, but these just give you more information about the scenery and you can basically eventually choose all options. Sometimes she asks you what you want to do without giving you options - we found that if this happens you can say ""what are my choices?"" and she'll tell you.
Having Alexa tell a story - especially a story - is a bit boring since there is no emotion to her voice. They do have some sound clips to add to it, but would be better if they recorded this with a voice with inflection and feeling.
Basically it was a really long not overly interesting ""adventure"" that we didn't even finish because she randomly turned herself off.

Cons: it can be a little for frustrating finding the exact word it wants to complete an action. It's usually exactly what it asked if you wanted to do but sometimes you have to experiment.

Just a couple of suggestions, and I don't know if they're possible, but would be nice of they could be implemented. First, is it possible to get Alexa to recognize the phonetic alphabet? I have tried over a dozen times to get the weather for KCXP, and she always replies that she can't find a METAR for KCXC. She hears KMEV correctly, but seems to have an issue with P. Second, is there a way to pause for a second between elements? It is awesome that she gives the measurements in different units (SM / KM) but I find I have to listen a few times because she'll go through too quickly.
Otherwise, very cool skill! Thank you!",Almost there!!!,1456876800,4.0,,807

Hopefully the number of questions which are available during the game is large enough.  A small pool of questions would make replaying the game a bit boring, only because over time a person would eventually learn the correct answers to all of the questions.

Of course any of these type of question and answer skills would suffer from a small pool of questions.

Again I must stress that I have not played the skill enough to tell how big the question pool is.

And it might be good if there was an option to have Alexa ask the player more than five questions per game.

Did a bit of research leading to OurGroceries, works quickly across all needed devices.

+Simple setup, using a single primary email, but allowing as many family members and devices to link to the account and see the shared lists as desired.
+ ALEXA integration works acceptably, i.e., requires saying ""Open OurGroceries"" then adding whatever you want to whatever list you'd like.  Having to OPEN the app vocally each time is a bit of pain, but is still so fast vs. writing it down somewhere that it's ok.  Still, an obvious area for improvement as others have mentioned in their reviews of this skill, i.e., it should be possible to open the app ONCE on Alexa and add MULTIPLE  items.  If this is a limitation of the Alexa SDK/environment as I suspect, then Amazon needs to enable this, so vendors can make this obvious improvement both in OurGroceries and many other apps.  Minus one star for this issue with the Alexa skill, regardless of who is responsible.
+ EXCELLENT in-store experience on Android, much better than the Alexa app for shopping a list live in store.  Carefully thought out details like cross-outs at top or bottom of list, long press to mark items off, ability to bring back cross-outs to build next shopping list, ability to easily move items within a list (reorder manually or sort different ways) and between lists (e.g., two different stores each with their own list).  Just very nice and efficient.
+ PC integration means it's super easy to build lists that are a little more complex and then use/modify these on the phone.

If you own any Alexa-enabled device, you can ask it to add items to your OurGroceries shopping lists using your voice. To make this possible, follow these steps:

***You&rsquo;ll need your OurGroceries master email address and password. If you don&rsquo;t have a password, create one first. [...] ***

Launch the Alexa app on your mobile phone, open the menu on the left, tap &ldquo;Skills&rdquo;, then search for &ldquo;OurGroceries&rdquo;. Tap the &ldquo;Enable&rdquo; button to enable the skill.
The Alexa app will ask for your OurGroceries master email address and password. This information will go straight to OurGroceries. Alexa will not know your password, and your information will be transmitted securely to us. Enter the information from step 1 and tap &ldquo;Sign In&rdquo;.

Be sure that the OurGroceries skill is properly installed in your Alexa account. Use the Alexa app on your phone to check your list of installed skills. (Tap &ldquo;Skills&rdquo; in the menu on the left, then select &ldquo;Your Skills&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Refine&rdquo; menu.)
If you have multiple profiles on your Alexa device, be sure that the active profile is the one you installed the skill on. It&rsquo;s easiest to install the OurGroceries skill on all your profiles.

Again, you must use the exact name of the device as it appears in the emPower section of your Alarm.com account. This is not rocket science.

Here is some help:
&bull; name lights in an area that you want grouped with the same first word-living room wall, living room table, living room floor. This allows you to turn the lights on as a group or individually. ""Alexa, ask Alarm.com to turn on THE living room lights."" It's critical to say THE and put an 'S' on the end of the word lights.  ""Alexa, ask Alarm.com to turn off the living room wall light.""  I put Christmas trees on two GE wall switches and names them Christmas One and Christmas two and I can say, ""Alexa, ask Alarm.com to turn on the Christmas trees.""
&bull; you can arm and lock but not disarm and unlock. I see the point of that security step but it would be cool if we could say ""Alexa, ask Alarm.com to disarm the the alarm"" the she asks ""what is the password (or PIN.""
&bull; you can dim lights by saying, Alexa, ask Alarm.com to set porch lights to 50-percent.""

Success with this skill is highly depending on how devices are named on the Alarm.com website.  Instead of supporting ""rooms"" or ""zones"" like other home automation solutions, it controls multiple lights based on having a common word or words in the device name.  Spent hours renaming devices and trying to get desired results with some success, extreme frustration, and ultimate disappointment.

For example, I have 4 z-wave devices in my Family Room.  One is a switch on a ceiling fan.  One is for an overhead light on the fan, which I rarely turn on.  The other two are for lamps in the room, which I normally use daily.  I had to play naming games.  If I asked to turn on the family room lights before tweaking, all 4 would come on.  So my ceiling fan has to be named something without ""Family Room"" in the device name.  Not too happy about that, as I have 2 other z-wave ceiling fan switches in my home.  Still not happy with result.  Do I have to go so far as create a numbering scheme and name them ""Fan 1"", ""Fan 2"", and ""Fan 3""?  And I'm supposed to memorize which is which???  Also had to remove ""Family Room"" text from my ""Family Room Overhead"" device to keep it from turning on daily.  Now it's name is completely non-intuitive, difficult to remember, and I end up hunting for my iPhone or iPad anyway.  ALARM.COM, GIVE US A GUIDE TO EFFECTIVE DEVICE NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS WITH DOZENS OF Z-WAVE DEVICES WITH MULTIPLE DEVICES IN SAME ROOM AS WELL AS MULTIPLE DEVICE TYPES (I.E., FANS, OVERHEADS, ETC.) IN DIFFERENT ROOMS.

Beyond this frustration, they also key on ""light"" vs ""lights"" to distinguish between a single device and multiple devices.  Guess how often your echo things you said plural when you didn't, and vice versa!  I would think a developer of a voice control application would recognize and provide alternatives for this.  And the back end that processes commands seems inconsistent!  I have said the same command repeatedly, verified the words Alexa heard in the Alexa app, and get different results!  Sometimes command works!  Sometimes it doesn't and gives strange errors related to thermostats or door locks!

THIS IS SO AWESOME.....Exactly what I've been waiting for.  I bought the new GC3 panel from 2gig last month and have been dyeing to get this functionality with Amazon's Echo with Alexa.  In the Alexa App, I Downloaded the Skill, logged in, and it instantly she instantly started working!

HINTS:
The commands are EXTREMELY sensitive to how you phrase them.  If you don't say it in the exact order, Shewon't understand you.
To control your lights: ""Tell alarm dot com to turn on the kitchen lights"".  She responds ""turning on two lights (because I have two kitchen lights programmed"".  If I said ""Tell alarm dot com to turn the kitchen lights on""  she understands nothing.  So be very methodical when asking.  She recognizes my lights specifically as I've named them in my GC3 device.  If I say ""tell alarm dot com to turn on the Kitchen Bar Lights"" she turns on only the kitchen bar lights and not both my kitchen lights.

Ask Alarm.com to lock the back door. - She locked the back door!
Ask Alarm.com to Dim Kitchen Lights to 5% - she dims to 5 percent.

I had to do no discovery of devices like others have mentioned.  Again, that may be because I have a 2Gig GC3 panel which is very new.  But I would like to get the system to recognize my devices to shorten my requests.  I'll update if I discover how to do this. other reviewers have mentioned it.

Lastly, Alarm.com released a new update under your emPower settings.  Just this week as part of this release, you will now have Scenes, so go set up the scenes.  I don't know if Alexa can control Scenes yet, but I sure hope she can, or will soon.

Once you've enabled and linked the app to Alarm.com with your username and password, you can go into the ""Smart Home"" area in the Alexa app and have it discover your devices.  It currently will only discover your emPower Devices, so on Alarm.com you may want to give them one or two word device names so they are easier to invoke.  Also at the top of the ""Smart Home"" area you can create groups like ""Living Room Lights"" or ""All Lights"".

Now that you have them in the ""Smart Home"" area you can use the short command:
Alexa... turn on living room lights  instead of Alexa... ask alarm dot com to turn on living room lights
Alexa... turn off living room lights  instead of Alexa... ask alarm dot com to turn off living room lights

Here are examples of other useful ""ask alarm dot com"" commands:
Alexa... ask alarm dot com to lock all doors
Alexa... ask alarm dot com to arm system stay

For security reasons your can't use these commands:
Alexa... ask alarm dot com to unlock all doors
Alexa... ask alarm dot com to disarm system
Alexa... ask alarm dot com to arm system away

Also, key actions are also missing that are no-brainers: asking the temperature setting, asking what the temperature of a specific room is, allowing a temperature change to only be in effect until the next scheduled comfort setting comes into play.

Again, this should not be that difficult to set straight. We are only looking for a few simple commands and responses to be available.

there was a yellow wire. a green wire ..... white wire and a red wire....and a jumper wire between RC and Rh that's all...

I had no C wire and this absolutely 100% works on my system with no C wire the batteries keep the screen lit .......

the wifi everything hooks up fine.....

2,False,"11 26, 2017",ACYZXQ2JKPZKT,B01EIQLWUS,N. Hyland,"- You have to be sure to set it up right and know the right name of the thermostat. I seemed to use ""thermostat"" a lot and Alexa did confirm the temp change but, I soon realized, no change had happened! I looked and I had named it ""home"". So I changed it to thermostat.
- I would skip using auto mode, Sensi and Alexa just cannot handle it at all. Just use heat mode in winter and cool mode in summer.
When cooling season ended (no cooling at all needed) the AC came on when Sensi/Alexa narrowed the temp difference of heat and cool. I am not sure WHY it does this. Very annoying. If you have a narrow temp range, like 69 in winter and 71 or 72 in summer, it just can't handle it at all during seasonal changes. I think this is mostly a Sensi (and dumb engineering and coding decisions at Emerson) problem.
The fix was to go from auto to JUST heat in winter, AC in summer.
The only place not having auto may be a problem are parts of California, the desert states, and similar regional climates where, some times of the year, days can be hot and nights pretty cold. Also, for a few weeks in autumn and spring where four seasons are common.
- There is a slight delay before any temperature change is gotten by the thermostat. You have to be patient. I think because the Alexa sends it to an Alexa cloud server which then connects to the Skill which sends the change to Emerson's Sensi cloud which sends it to the Sensi in your home. Adds about 5 seconds or so to any request. (I wonder how this compares to EcoBee or Nest or other smart thermostat performance with Alexa/Google Home?)
- You cannot ask Alexa to turn on the system fan during heat or cool or, fan only when the heat and cool are both off. Useful in homes where the second floor is an attic, like a Cap Cod style, when you want to circulate conditioned air or just circulate air more into that space when the system is between cycles of heat or cool or just off.
- You cannot ask Alexa for a humidistat reading from the Sensi thermostat either.
The various issues I mention above are why I gave it a low rating. These are all human caused and human fixable problems. Most are related to Sensi and how this Skill works. Emerson is to blame.","Limited, make sure you set up the name of the Sensi so it works",1511654400,5.0,,2202

Now why Alexa can't do this, and Google Assistant and Google Home devices can do it... I don't know... BUT I know it CAN be done.
Is the feature lack a short coming of Sensi not making the feature available to Alexa specifically, or is it just minimalistic programming work on behalf of the programmers on the side of Alexa? I have had my Sensi thermostat for well over a year now, and I've seen them provide many updates to the Android phone version of the Sensi App, so I know they are making improvements all the time, but still this may be a shortcoming on the side of Alexa and not Sensi themselves?

  Alexa, turn the ""YourThermostatName"" up.
  Alexa, turn the ""YourThermostatName"" up by 3 degrees.
  Alexa, turn the ""YourThermostatName"" down.
  Alexa, turn the ""YourThermostatName"" down by 3 degrees.
  Alexa, set the ""YourThermostatName"" to 73 degrees.

It also understands if you say the word ""up"" or ""down"" right after the word ""turn"":

  Alexa, turn up the ""YourThermostatName"" by 2 degrees.

You have to say your thermostat name exactly the way you named it when setting it up.  In particular, if your thermostat name doesn't have the word thermostat in it, then don't say the word thermostat.  If you only have one thermostat, I recommend just naming it ""thermostat"".

One thing I wish it could do is tell you the temperature.  If I asked it:

  Alexa, what is the temperature of the ""YourThermostatName""?

There is no subscription (ongoing fees) to use this. (Only the initial cost of hub and any devices you get to work with it...)

5,False,"06 28, 2017",A26JVHFS6147YZ,B01EIQOOUS,Pacifica,"I designed my home with almost all lights either controlled by programmable Lutron switches (e.g. bathrooms and closets) where I want lighting based on occupancy, or by Insteon switches, light bulbs, plug in modules, and motion sensors (e.g. great room, kitchen, bedroom, office, and outdoor lighting) where I want the ability to control the lighting by scenes or with multiple triggers. I have a multi-purpose open plan great room with many layers of lighting and there is a confusing array of light switches.  Insteon let me ""hide"" some of the light switches that let me finely control my lighting and install keypads in obvious places that can control scenes. Between the time that the house was completed and when I was able to implement the Insteon Hub to control the lights, I saw that the Amazon Echo Dot would work with Insteon so I added that to my system.  I finally got everything set up this past week.  I could not be happier!

Now I can say, ""Alexa, turn on movie lights"" and all of the lights in my entryway, deck, and great room dim to off in 20 seconds while my island counter pendant lights remain on at 15% and the side counter under cabinet lights remain on at 20%.  After the movie I say, ""Alexa, turn on normal lights"", and my great room and entry lights slowly come on to between 50 and 75%, depending on the light.  I can also ask for low lighting, bright lighting, and dining lighting to access other scenes I programmed.  I can also ask for bedroom or guest room lights turned on or off and I can have just the left or right bedside light turned on or off.  Each of these can be on, on 50%, or on at any other power.  I have similar functionality for all of my outdoor lighting, including ""panic lights"" which turn on all of my outdoor lights in an instant if I hear a noise outside at night.

Figuring out how to set everything up was pretty easy.  I am still fine-tuning everything, especially names that Alexa can uniquely identify and that I can remember, but I did all of the initial setup for both the Insteon Hub and Alexa in one evening.  I've also simplified some of my scenes, since having multiple scenes ""on"" that include the same light at different levels did not always yield the same results.

You can create groups directly in Alexa and that also works really well.  The problem is that if I make changes in the Insteon Hub, the easiest way to update Alexa is to forget all of the scenes and devices and then to re-learn them (takes about 30 seconds).  This process deletes any groups in Alexa which then need to be set back up.  Setting up a group is very fast so I will probably use this for groups that I have a short term use for or need quickly, and then implement the groups for the longer term in the Insteon hub.

I like that Alexa recognizes the commands and that I do not need to identify Insteon.  It will help me achieve my goal of having a few simple commands that guests can remember and use.  I like that I can use either my Echo Dot or the remote control for my Amazon Fire TV, but the convenience of just speaking to control lights is enough to justify adding Echo Dots to my bedroom, office, and guest room.

I don't have heat, air conditioning, or a garage, or I am sure I would add those components to my system as well.  Also, the Insteon ceiling fan controller only works with the old style ceiling fans with the pull chains for the fan and light and not with newer systems with their own remote controls, or I would add in my ceiling fans, too. I haven't set up any scenes triggered by my motion sensors or by a schedule yet, but those triggers are independent of Alexa.

Get the small 'dot' and attach an audio cable to a 2 channel stereo and use two good speakers placed AWAY from the dot. Now you have voice command over your music library in HIGH FIDELITY STEREO. Set the dot up at the highest audio level and control and then control the volume with the stereo. That way you have the best signal/noise ratio. It blows people away. You can still lower the volume by telling Alexa to lower volume. Just set it up correctly  from the beginning by having the loudest sound you will ever want on Alexa's volume 10.

A key reason this product has so many poor reviews is because very few, even the technologically competent, can figure out the magical formula to get the thing to do one simple task, turn on a light.

This plug requires that you download an app for the plug onto your phone, then set up a new account with an unknown company, then wrestle through a convoluted process by which you have to connect the phone to a network the phone generates, then manually connect the plug to your network, then figure out that you&rsquo;re supposed to reconnect your phone to your home network after connecting it to the plug network. You then have to download yet another app so Echo can recognize the plug. Since this plug only works on a 2.4 GH network, you may have to change your entire Echo setup to a 2.4 GH network. I have four echos, five security cameras, and some other stuff that I needed to switch before they could get close to making this work. The instructions for connecting the plug to an echo are written in essay format with missing steps. An essential step is the Easter egg hunt you have to go on to find the setting for remote control. It does not appear until after you have downloaded the apps, set up new accounts, and guessed at the instructions the tp-link figures you should be able to figure out yourself.

Just as I was about to send it back, I read a review from a customer who had figured it out. His simple instructions worked!

What is wrong with a company that can&rsquo;t even provide simple instructions?

A purpose of smart home technology is to make things simpler, easier. But if the customer can&rsquo;t get beyond the setup, the company has a long way to go to show some smarts.

How smart is a device that requires so many layers of technology and setup to do a simple task like turn on a light. To be &ldquo;Smart&rdquo; a product should be a single click setup without having to open multiple accounts and download multiple apps, just so I can have Alexa turn off a light.

I did get it to work. I can say &ldquo;Alexa, turn off the bedroom light&rdquo;, and the light sitting next to me will turn off. What a lazy putz do I have to be to not be able to reach my arm up and flip a switch?

I can even say ""Alexa, kitchen light 100%"" (or any whole number between 1 and 100) and the light responds by dimming to the requested level, just like the shields on the Starship Enterprise.

But...

Sometimes Alexa can't control the smart bulb. Usually, I just have to turn off the power to the bulb for a minute, but once in a while, I have to re-link the skill. Alexa will actually tell me I have to do this in her own words. R-linking the skill is a tedious process of disabling the skill, adding it again, which then make Alexa see the Smart Bulb again. This seems to happen when there is an interruption to WiFi, like rebooting the router.  Coincidentally, whenever this happens, the KASA app on my phone still controls the light just fine, the only issue with Alexa, but, that's still a huge annoyance.

I still recommend this app, but if you are installing this device for a non-technical person, you may want to explore all the smart light options available.

TIP: Make sure the 2.4GHz coverage is strong where your smart bulb or smart switch are located. You may consider a booster or relocation of your WiFi router. I also live in an urban area with more then 100 WiFi networks available at any given moment.

TIP 2: If you reset your router, turn off the power to the Smart Bulb for a second (unplug the lamp, turn off the wall switch, etc), wait 10 seconds, and give it power again. That will cause the bulb to turn on full brightness, and probably resolve Alexa.

Whenever I'm having this problem, the Smart Bulb is still responding to the KASA app on my phone, it's the KASA <-> Alexa connection that seems to have a problem.

Kasa and Amazon need to work together more closely to allow the skills to work without this hassle, for example, Kasa should poll Alexa to check in and make sure security tokens are still active, etc.","When it works, it's great, but sometimes you have to relink the skill for no apparent reason.",1520812800,6.0,,1975

I didn't want to put such a low rating here but I have to.

Kasa's integration with Alexa is quite awful.

I have 2 multicolor light bulbs and one smart switch. All from a TP link.

I do everything as per guide, authorize my account push discover devices and then Alexa gives me a message ""Discovery Failed"".

Thats it can't go beyond this point.

If anyone knows how to troubleshoot it please advise.

-=UPDATE=-

So I've been trying to make Alexa Smart Home features work.
I kept pushing discover devices and Alexa kept showing message Discovery Failed. I deleted my devices from KASA and reinstalled them again but nothing happened(Did it like 3 times). Every time I've been pushing button Discover Devices it was a failure.

-=Solution=-

My Kasa app was opened on IOS on the SmartPlug(HS105) screen.
Then I tried to use voice command and said: ""Alexa - Discover Devices"" and BOOM: ""You have 3 Devices"".
Finally It worked. Hope it stays functional.

Now it seems like developers of Alexa need to figure out whats wrong with Discover Button since it wasn't working at all. Tried the Voice command - and here is a miracle. It worked. Even now when all is fine and I Push ""Discover Devices"" loading window does the same lookup for a second and shows a failure so it's smth. to do with the button. Gladly - voice command solved my issue.

Hope this helps to anybody.

My system consisted of the Lutron switches, blinds on the windows, and two eco-bee thermostats. It was very easy to control everything from my Lutron app but either I would have to open it, or press my thumb on my iPhone and get Siri to listen. The system wasn't bad, and I liked that I was able to turn the exterior lights on automatically at sunset each day and turn them off at sunrise, but my system really took off once I added Alexa.

It did not take me very long to adapt to having a smart home, it became so important that when I built another home I knew immediately what I wanted to do with it, my Caseta light switches were the first thing installed in my home. Building a smart home the second time is so much easier, my naming process was so much simpler for the lights, and this time I ditched the Ecobee thermostats in favor of the Nest, I find the Nest to be much more intuitive to use, a lot of times with my ecobee I had a difficult time figuring out how to set the schedule.  But I will say this, controlling my Ecobee thermostat's was actually easier through the Lutron app as opposed to their own native app.

My only complaint is that I cannot get it to control my ceiling fans, my lights were strobing when connected with the Lutron switch so I needed to resume using traditional switches.",Installed Caseta in my second home,1489968000,3.0,,1454

The 2nd problem is Alexa only allows one login thus one hub.

Apple HomeKit somehow supports combining the different logins and hubs. That works ok but Alexa voice recognition is better.

This needs to be simple, quick and efficient.  The listing all of my ingredients, when I already had to go in and specify what I would order ahead of time, is pointless.

There were a couple of times it looked like the ISY server wasn't responding, Alexa claimed there was no such device when asked to do an ISY operation, but those cleared up and I haven't seen any lately. I also have a Harmony Ultimate and I'd already set up ISY/Harmony integration via IR codes. I've set up my Harmony with Alexa and have now stopped using the IR linking. The Harmony integration isn't as good as ISY, but it's good enough that I can now seamlessly give commands that trigger both setups. (Alexa groups are nice). What is missing (and it's not the fault of the ISY integration) is decent command chaining, e.g., ""Alexa turn on x and turn off y"",  It's a pain to have to separate those into two separate spoken commands. Being able to tie commands to timers would be great also.

Good news:
When I first saw this skill, I was hesitant since I was already using mobilinc with the ISY portal. But when I saw the glowing reviews for this skill, I decided to try it. I had to submit a request to have MobiLinc removed from the portal & I followed the necessary steps to setup my ISY. Once it got setup, I was very elated!! I know longer had to say ""Alexa, ask mobilinc..."". Furthermore, I now can use Alexa to turn on my fanlinc controlled ceiling fans, which work using scenes. Because I have 3 different ceiling fans, my scenes are named by room, the word ""fan"", followed by the fan speed. When I ask Alexa to turn on a particular scene for a fan speed, she tells me there are several devices matching that name and asks which one did I want. I then repeat the name, and then Alexa gets it right and turns on the fan to the desired speed. What's also nice is that the ISY portal allows you to add alternate spoken names for each device/scene. I'm very excited.

Bad news:
Last night I came home and was unable to control my devices. I thought maybe Alexa didn't understand me or was having a temporary hiccup. So I asked her to discover devices and still they did not work. Upon looking at the devices in the Alexa app, my devices no longer displayed. Instead, I was seeing another homeowners devices display. They were totally different & appeared to have French words for the devices. Basically it seemed like my Amazon echo account was linked to someone else's ISY account. I tried numerous times to have Alexa forget all devices, disable the skill, and then setup the skill again. Eventually I got it working right. This is VERY alarming that this happened in the first place because I could have controlled the other homeowners devices if I wanted to, which included a garage door & thermostat, in addition to lighting. And vice versa, someone could potentially control my devices. I don't understand how this happened in the first place, and I think both Amazon and ISY need to get together and investigate how this happened and implement better security, etc. to prevent this from happening again!",Good news and bad news review,1481241600,56.0,,2163

**** Update continued below ***********

This company (iDevices support) initially tried blaming Amazon which led me to hours of technical support calls with Amazon Alexa support. Instead of kicking the can and blaming Amazon, if they would have just admitted it was their problem in the first place they would have saved me hours of frustration with the Alexa support people. Also, the fact that it takes weeks to resolve a network or software issue is pretty bad in itself. Do they outsource their engineers? This issue is still unresolved as of 12/18/17. I can't recommend iDevices and hope Amazon removes the iDevices skill and the ""Works with Alexa"" certification from this company.",No longer works.,1512345600,7.0,,1061

However, there were times I needed just a little bit more information on a given day; particularly specifics about the rain or snow.  I would usually follow up the weather on the Dot by checking the 'Dark Skies' app on my phone on those particular days.  NOW, with BIG SKY on my Dot, I can just ask Alexa for 'the weather' or 'Big Sky' and not have to follow up on either with anything else.  'Big Sky 'has just the right information, including special Weather Warnings and Statements that you can ask for additionally, but without all the references to what the weather is doing in some other part of the country, or even the state, and how it will impact my area 'maybe' in a day or a week.  No fronts, depressions, etc. Weather reporting is barely accurate on a daily basis, much less a week ahead of time.  That being said, I would sometimes like tomorrow's projected weather on' Big Sky'.'  Tomorrow's weather, indeed a week's worth of weather, IS available on the 'Dark Sky' app and you can ask Alexa for tomorrow's, or even next weekend's, weather anytime.  There may be a way to get tomorrow's weather on 'Big Sky' on my Dot; but I either am overlooking that information or it hasn't be described to me how to ask Dot for it.  Anyone know the details?

I only found this out after I found a response on Amazon's Feedback. I called customer support...which is pretty frustrating in an of itself. The hours are 8am to 4pm est. Monday - Friday. That is all fine and well, but when you work and have to try and contact support for your devices, you often forget that you need customer support until you get home - after 5pm.

Second -  I set up a guest network on my Apple AirPort Extreme 2.5 Ghz. on the latest firmware 7.7.8 as well as reset 2 Air Port Express's firmware 7.6.8 that I have setup in the house. Reset all the devices including my modem, router, (2) iPhone 6/ 6S on 10.2 and plugs -  and followed the ""new way"" of setting up the devices - which I read online from the IHome site. Customer service repeated the steps on the phone. Got them all online, and updated every plug to the latest firmware as of writing this review to 0.8.84

Great, got them all setup, all was good...but then all but one went off line with the ""Red"" exclamation point within 2 hours. Back to resetting all the devices and starting over - again.

Third - Day number 4 - reset all devices (see above for devices), got them all online - verified firmware was up to date. Good to go - NOT!

Within hours, 2 of the 4 outlets went offline. I uninstalled/ reinstalled the app on my iPhone, no change. More research - resetting device by unplugging for 5-10 seconds, and we are back online again. According to the IHome site, with the latest firmware, you should not have to reset by unplugging. That is a fail...anyway, I unplugged all 4 outlets waited 10 to 20 seconds, and 3 of the 4 came back online. 1 seems to need to be completely reset again.

Quick check again of the online outlets show correct firmware, and when I clicked to ""check for any updates"" - 2 of the 3 outlets that are online state ""Unable to verify Wi-Fi connection"".

I waited for an hour to check the status of the plugs that were working, after I reset, unplugged went through all the process's yet again, and after 1 hour, 3 of the 4 outlets are now offline again. They never seem to stay online very long.

Pros: Cool idea, Love the concept, when it works - it's pretty cool

Cons: Original documentation is very vague and dated, Customer support - while a very nice person answers, It's busy or it's a pretty long hold time if you can remember to call during working hours. Constantly the plugs are failing - offline, have to unplug or reset and start over ( I have lost track how many times I have had to do this), have to be on a ""2.5Ghz Network"" (still have not figured out why this is mandatory when it worked on a 5Ghz Network on day one - if it is because of the firmware updates, I think you should roll back ;-)

Conclusion: I almost threw these things away or wanted to smash them into a million pieces, but then I remembered how much they cost and should work...so controlling frustrations is a must with these plugs. Here is a great idea iHome - if you make it mandatory to change a preference like; Network connection, Firmware updates, iCloud connections for Echo, why not email the customer these important updates, procedure or steps and troubleshooting FAQ's - You have our address when we register on the iHome app. Obviously you would need an option for customer to ""opt out"" when they register.

Speaking of email, why not have a support forum on your site or email to customer service for help. With all the negative feedback on these plugs, you would be better off having a forum for customers to get help at anytime. If my testing team had released a product into production or it's customers - we would all be fired.

It's a sad shame that I have to write a review of your product on Amazon with hope that the iHome team will respond to my feedback.",Frustrating to say the least...,1483920000,22.0,,4960

After enabling the Nexia skill, and clicking on Discover Devices in the Alexa Smart Home setup, Alexa will discover your lights and several other things in your Nexia system. However it will not discover some items you may want to control, but were not discovered. But Nexia was quite clever in creating a way for you to ADD items that Alexa CAN discover to control virtually everything you desire. Here's how.

Use Nexia Automations to create DISCOVERABLE ITEMS  for Alexa

Let's say that you want to lock your Schlage lock on your front door with the command, ""Alexa, Turn Lock Up on"", here's how to do it.

1. Go the Nexia site and create a new Automation
2. Name the Automation Lock Up, add the Description, ""Alexa - Turn Lock Up on""
3. In the If This Happens Box, select 3rd party integration and then Amazon Alexa, and click Ok.
4. In the Do This Box, Add Action, select Lock, then the lock you want, and then Locked and click Ok.
5. In the Do This Box, select Add Action, select Alert, and type ""Alexa Turn Lock Up On locked front door"" in the box, then click Ok. This is optional, but is a nice way to know that Nexia received the command.
6. At the bottom of the screen, check all the MODES that you want this Automation to work in.
7. Click Save Changes
8. Go to the Alexa app on your phone
9. Go to Settings, then Smart Home
10. Scroll down to Your Devices and then click on Discover devices link
11. Test by saying, Alexa, turn Lock Up on.

Let's say that you want to set your Nexa MODE to Sleep (or any other Mode you desire)

1. Go to the Nexia site and create a new Automation
2. Name the Automation Sleep, add the Description, ""Alexa - Turn Sleep on""
3. In the If This Happens Box, select 3rd party integration and then Amazon Alexa, and click Ok.
4. In the Do This Box, Add Action, select Alert, and type ""Alexa Turn Sleep On"" in the box, then click Ok. This is optional, but is a nice way to know that Nexia got the command.
5. In the Do This Box, Add Action, select Mode, Select Sleep (or any other mode you want)
6. At the bottom of the screen, check all the MODES that you want this Automation to work in.
7. Click Save Changes
8. Go to the Alexa app on your phone
9. Go to Settings, then Smart Home
10. Scroll down to Your Devices and then click on Discover devices link
11. Test by saying, Alexa, turn Sleep on.

Let's say you want to set your thermostat(s) to a certain temperature:

1. Go to the Nexia site and create a new Automation
2. Name the Automation ""Heat"" (or whatever you want), add the Description, ""Alexa - Turn Heat On""
3. In the If This Happens Box, select 3rd party integration and then Amazon Alexa, and click Ok.
4. In the Do This Box, Add Action, select Alert, and type ""Alexa Turn Heat On"" in the box, then click Ok. This is optional, but is a nice way to know that Nexia got the command.
5. In the Do This Box, Add Action, select Thermostats, select your thermostat, select temperature range, the click Ok.
6. At the bottom of the screen, check all the MODES that you want this Automation to work in.
7. Click Save Changes
8. Go to the Alexa app on your phone
9. Go to Settings, then Smart Home
10. Scroll down to Your Devices and then click on Discover devices link
11. Test by saying, Alexa, turn Heat on.

These are just a few ways to create Alexa commands for Nexia. You can create commands to do almost anything Nexia can do via the Nexia app or website. The only thing you CAN NOT do is to UNLOCK locks. Nexia does not support this for security reasons.

I hope this helps some of you who have wanted Alexa to do more, but didn't know how.

Good luck and happy Automating!",Alexa works GREAT with Nexia - Use Automations to create any command you want!,1478304000,65.0,,3794
5,False,"10 24, 2016",A2KT99PDQD2554,B01H65IJMC,Edward N. Ryan Jr.,I've been waiting for this for a long time. I've had my Trane unit connected to my PC and cell phone since the unit was installed about two years ago. Now my Echo can control it by voice. It's especially handy when I'm in bed at night and it gets too cold (hot) in the bedroom. I don't have to get up and trot downstairs to make a thermostat adjustment. I just roll over and tell the bedroom echo to; lower (raise) the thermostat 2 degrees; and it's done. I roll over and go back to sleep. What a great concept.,This is Great!,1477267200,7.0,,511

4,False,"09 30, 2016",A2ECT81F3TLWSL,B01H65IJMC,K. Warkman,"So far so good. When asking Alexa to turn on/off lights it responds very quickly.  Also understands commands basically every time. One issue I would like to see fixed is when asking to turn on a light that is on a dimmer switch the light goes on to 100%. I wish it would just turn that dimmer switch on to it's last % setting that the light was on. So you have to ask Alexa to turn on the light to say 30% for the light to not go full blast. Minor issue but not as simple as it could be.  A nice feature I would like to see added would be to allow voice notifications through the Echo. So for example if your motion detector picks up motion Alexa would say something like ""Motion detected at your front door"" or wherever you have your motion detector.  For door sensors the Echo could say ""basement door has been opened"" and so on. Of course it could be a notification option that could be turned off if you prefer. But I would appreciate having that feature.  I see some people not happy that the Echo doesn't control Schlage locks. I see both sides of the argument of not having the locks included for safety. I wouldn't want my door opened by someone just asking Alexa to open my front door.  I also see the side of wanting it included as well. I think at least the feature to ask The Echo to lock your door would be nice to have. I would use that feature way more anyway rather than asking Alexa to open my door. At least if the command could only lock the door no one is in jeopardy.  I understand having the Amazon Echo added to the Nexia ecosystem is still early but so far it's pretty impressive.  Let's just hope we can keep getting some new and exciting features added periodically.","Impressed, but have some ideas...",1475193600,14.0,,1692

She will switch between regular heat/cool/off settings but she doesn't recognize the words ""emergency heat"", ""EMheat"" or anything else I can think of. Not a big deal though as I can manually switch to emergency heat via the app.

One other bug is the app shows the ""fan is on"" indicators when the fans are not actually on.  Heat and fans will cycle off then ""fan is on"" appears on the apps after the ""heat is on"" display turns off.. This is only displayed via the apps and not on the actual thermostats.

I have two AC units/thermostats. Despite the fact that my Honeywell Thermostat app said Upstairs and Downstairs, Alexa kept saying that both of my thermostats had the same name.

When on the Control Center > My Locations menu, click on View Thermostat(s) and then click on Menu. From there you can name your specific thermostat.

If, when you are on the Control Center > My Locations menu, you click on the Settings icon on the right, it will show you the *Locations* name (among other things). That's not what you want here. You want the actual thermostat name.

Finally, when you are asking Alexa to make changes, I have found that if I say, ""Alexa, set downstairs to 74 degrees"" (""downstairs"" is the complete name given to one of my thermostats), it will work perfectly. However, if I say, ""Alexa, set the downstairs thermostat to 74 degrees"" it will not work.

I have added one additional thermostat since last review and both the Honeywell server and skill have been working near flawlessly.  Here in New England would still want to be able to switch between heat, cool, and off modes with Alexa.  Minor inconvenience but would be 5 stars with it.

I have had 4 Honeywell thermostats for a couple of years (2 each of RTH8580WF and RTH6580WF).  For the most part they have worked well with the Honeywell Connect app/web.  Occasional loss of communications have occurred but nothing long term or retry command did not fix.  I recently started using them with the Alexa Skill.  It appeared that Alexa had been taking the commands for all thermostats because she responded in the affirmative when asked say ""set <thermostat name> to 65 degrees"".  However only one thermostat was actually working.  After reading other comments I found as mentioned that the other 3 thermostats would not work unless their schedule was overridden prior to the command.  Not very useful work around.  After analysis and experimentation I realized that the Alexa commands will work if you configure the heating system to type ""1"" (heat/cool).  This may not work for everyone but those that can ignore the cool controls (never use) it is a reasonable work around that allows you to still use the scheduling feature of the thermostats.  In general I like the thermostats. It would be five star if they do following:

- Fix bug with only working with Alexa commands if configured for Heat/Cool or schedule overridden
- Add ability to at least ask what the temperature is in a room thru Alexa.
- Additional commands to switch modes/fan would be nice but not in anyway a negative to me without them

The other three Honeywell thermostats required me to purchase the Honeywell THM6000R1002 RedLINK Internet gateway ($100). This gateway is needed to get the non WiFi thermostats to work. You will need to go to their website (mytotalconnectcomfort) to setup your account and add your thermostats to your system. To setup the thermostats I simply clicked on the ADD Thermostat button and typed in the MAC and CRC ID on the pop up window. The WiFi thermostat had it's own codes and the other three used the MAC/CRD ID from the gateway. All four thermostats installed perfectly fine. I then added the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort Smart Home item in Alexa and after typing in my Honeywell UserID/Password Discovery was run and all four thermostats were found without a problem.

Using my Echo, any changes to the upstairs temp (with an apparently lower/older thermostat firmware version) are acknowledged by Alexa and made immediately.  As expected, this works when the thermostat is following a schedule or if a temporary or permanent hold is in place.

However, temp changes via my Echo to the downstairs temp (with an apparently higher/newer thermostat firmware version) are always acknowledged by Alexa  but never work properly when the thermostat is following a schedule.  Oddly, temp changes via my Echo do work correctly when a temporary or permanent hold is in place.

For example, when following a schedule:

-Alexa, set downstairs to 70 (acknowledged but does _NOT_ work)
-Manually set downstairs temporary hold to 65 via iOS app
-Alexa, set downstairs to 70 (WORKS!)

That being said, this skill was easy to set up and there is lots of potential here once these apparent thermostat software quality issues get sorted out.

1,False,"11 5, 2016",A33KK1JZR6HE7O,B01HCB4Y5Q,E. Ziegler,"I agree with all the other reviews about the inconsistencies of the product. There are two main issues.  First is that you can't ask it what the temperature is. The second is the inability for it to actually change the temperature. After some experimentation I understand it's ""inconsistent behavior"" mentioned by others. If the thermostat is in manual override mode it works just fine it will raise and lower the temperature accordingly. However, if it's in a weekly program mode and it's running the program mode it will not take the commands. If you manually override by using either the touchpad on the thermostat or the application on your phone then Alexa will be able to change the temperature. Here's the problem, you have to go to the Thermostat or use your iPhone app first rather than Alexa just putting thermostat into manual override mode and then setting the temperature accordingly until the next program cycle when the thermostat would naturally change temperature back. having to do either of these kills all of the benefits of Alexa. My view is that this is an issue with the Alexa skill and not with with the thermostat. The reason I say this is because the iPhone app can make the override and then change the temperature. Therefore, there must be a set of wireless commands that can accomplish this.

When the bulb is lagging I'll simply wait and it will eventually catch up to the other two bulbs. When it loses connection I turn them all off with the wall switch then turn them back on about 30 seconds later. This resets them all and they're all usually good to go for a couple of days.

Also, this app had the next three trains, which is something other Bart apps didn't advertise. However, there are problems with the implementation.

The app doesn't give me the next train. When I ask, no matter what I ask, I'm getting the next 4 trains, and it takes a long time for Alexa to get through the list, because she says the departure time, arrival time and whether there are any delays for all four trains. (I think the delays was only stated once at the end of the list.) This is way too much processing time. I'd rather be able to ask about 1 - 3 trains (I don't need 4), and I really want it to be in terms of how many minutes from now instead of the actual departure time, and unless I ask for it, I don't need arrival times.

Finally, I hope this is being pulled from the realtime info, not the schedule, since that's what I really care about right now - the sort of info I would want to ask Alexa.

It gives you a series of numbers, and you have a few chances to work out what the correct next number should be. If you can't, you can give up. You can then move on to a new sequence, or quit.

Ease of Use: 2 out of 5. As designed, it is easy to work out how to use. However it runs up against Alexa's difficulty in accurately recognizing speech. There was one case where I got the answer right, but it heard me wrong. Because it didn't say what it thought it heard, I didn't know that it was a transcription error, and gave up. The number sequences are long enough and are read fast enough that's it is rather hard to play without also watching the sequences on the companion app. They are repeated in the reprompt, though.
Usefulness: 2 out of 5. Maybe it's me, but the puzzles are rather hard. The only one I got right it misheard the answer on. Because of Alexa's timeout, you have to get the answer pretty quickly. That narrows down the audience of who can use this. You have to be both numerically adept and quick thinking. My Math degree didn't help!
When you give up, it tells you the right answer, but doesn't tell you why it is the right answer. That would give a bit more satisfaction and make it slightly more educational.
Novelty: 4 out of 5. I've been looking for verbal puzzles to implement. Never thought of number sequences. It's a brilliant idea, since it can be varied a lot, and is simple to implement.

A few of the readings came out a bit weird, due to Alexa's Text To Speech, and those could have been edited or removed. Also, it doesn't put up any companion app cards, so I couldn't check out the text of it when it went wrong, or when I really liked it and wanted to copy it.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. This fits the scenario of ""I'm sitting on my couch, drinking a beer, and I..."". It's a ""timewaster app"", but, then again, so are the mobile apps I use the most. I can't fault it for that.

Novelty: 1 out of 5. I'm pretty sure the developer threw this together in an hour or so. Although I admire the brilliance of  getting Amazon to select an app with so little work (unlike mine which is one of the ones that has been waiting months) there really isn't much there.

3,False,"12 5, 2015",A2L2Z1OPZGHF18,B0184JBP4I,Schaq,"Very useful for asking for next trains arriving at non-transfer stations. But it can't handle transfer stations. For example, it gives only Red Line train info for both Metro Center and Gallery Place, and it doesn't give any train info for L'Enfant Plaza station. It does, however, support multi-line stations that share the same tracks, e.g., it'll give times for both Green and Yellow line trains at Columbia Heights, Orange, Silver and Blue at Foggy Bottom, and Blue and Yellow at Pentagon.

Several other behaviors make it not user-friendly. It won't recognize questions if you don't use exactly the right words in exactly the right order (I'm not referring to the trigger phrase, ""Alexa, ask DC Metro...,"" which is required to invoke this skill). It doesn't allow you to specify particular lines or destinations, so at stations like Foggy Bottom you must listen to times for trains in both directions on all three lines (six total). By the time it gets to the third line it would have been faster to check the times on a smartphone, especially because the results are delivered in unnecessarily repetitive complete sentences. For example:

ALEXA:  ""For station Crystal City, on the Blue line towards Largo Town Center, a train is arriving in 8 minutes. On the Blue Line towards Franconia-Springfield, trains are arriving in 3, 7, and 13 minutes. On the Yellow line towards Mt. Vernon Sq....""

Concise answers would be much more useful. For example:

ALEXA:  ""Crystal City, Blue line: Largo Town Center in 8 minutes, Franconia-Springfield in 3, 7, and 13 minutes; Yellow line: Mt. Vernon Sq in....""

This could be a very useful app for quickly getting updated train times on your way out the door.

Nowadays, ELIZA is quite simplistic compared to newer and more advanced AI chatterbots, but it was highly regarded at the time. The ELIZA program originally accepted text input and responded in a similar fashion. The Alexa version turns the text based conversation into a more natural speaking conversation, with voice responses based on what you say. It's kind of a minor change but it definitely makes the conversation experience more immersive. The responses I got back definitely sound just like ELIZA, matching the text based version's very closely.

ELIZA pales in comparison to more modern chatterbots, but it is still fairly convincing to this day. The change from text to audio is a small yet big impact on how the conversation is experienced, and it makes things more fluid and natural.

While we've been together over a decade, it still has had some prompts for us that we never thought to ask one another- like ""can you play a musical instrument or did you ever take lessons for one?"" Well, he knew about my extensive studies in piano, I knew about his short try in piano, but since those were our ""big deal"" things involving playing an instrument, I guess I had never mentioned my three years in viola, my two in oboe, my ability to play notes on a tuba at three years old, or my repeated utter failures at learning guitar; he had never told me about his small stint in drums where he is very skilled that only ended because he could no longer afford lessons, or his success at learning some basic guitar on his own. We had lots of these kinds of interactions, which have been so fun, because the stories behind those lead to ""rabbit holes"" beyond them- like why I was trying to play a tuba at three years old, and the difficulties behind why he had to give up drums.
We only ever ask for one starter, and it will keep us going for weeks. We love this skill. Obviously, not every prompt is a winner (you tend to know most things about a person after 13-ish years), but it's super fun when we hit pay dirt. while I'm not sure about how well it would work in a group setting, it's pretty awesome for twosome conversation, and really marvelous with tap on road trips.",Love this!

Its very convenient for those times I do not have my phone right there or my hands are full.  Think of a time your running behind and making the morning coffee, just ask Alexa to run the ""wake up the kids"" scene, or before going up to bed tell Alexa to turn off basement lights and turn on all the outside lights etc.  There has been a few times that my phrase is not clearly understood depending on how far away I am from the Echo, not facing that direction, or even clearly enunciating (understandable).

I can control a set of devices with one command (request) so I don't have to micromanage my environment. I really don't have the patience to tell Alexa to turn this light on red at this percentage, and that light to white at this percentage (and so on) and also tell me the weather and my appointments for the day. It's annoying. I like my routines. I like to have everything just so and I like not having to worry that I forgot to set the house up for being away. I can just send Mosaic a message on Facebook and tell it ""Goodbye"". I can even see what the last request I made was by looking at my Facebook messages.

That said, the selection of workflows is still limited this early in the game but the developers are really responsive to input on what workflows would be cool to add. The upside is that you make the workflows what you want them to be. We needed to have a workflow to light up our back hallway and so on to full white brightness. The best workflow to choose was ""House Party"" because we are introverted hermits who would NEVER have a party. It's actually kind of amusing when we need to use it. (especially since Alexa usually tells us to make sure we have enough ice)

Having established workflows to call on makes it easier to avoid naming conventions that confuse Alexa's voice recognition.

All things considered, it's a really useful skill and we use the daylights out of it (unlike the Dog Facts skill).

Every morning, without fail, I ask Alexa to tell Mosaic ""Good Morning"". On comes my desk lamp, out goes the night light in the hall, living room lamp is set to a dim blue, laundry room light turns off (it's on at 50% at night for late snackers in the kitchen) and Alexa tells me my schedule and the daily forecast and current temperature.

However, the experience quickly goes downhill from there:
- The biggest problem - way too few questions. If you're a big Seinfeld fan, you're going to want to play this more than just a couple times. However, you will quickly start noticing questions you've already answered, and soon after that you'll be hoping just 1 of the 5 questions is one you haven't heard before.
- The App feels unpolished/unprofessional. Many questions contain clear misspellings that cause Alexa to pronounce words incorrectly. Many questions are phrased oddly or with poor grammar.
- Some of the questions/answers just feel lazy. E.g. for a question to which the correct answer is the book ""Tropic of Cancer"", two of the wrong options are ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Tropic of Thunder"".

Give Alexa the phone number. Send a text.  If you want to text a different number you must change it by saying, ""Alexa tell Scryb the number is....xxx-xxx-xxxx"" and then send the message.  Whatever number you gave Scryb last will be the number Alexa uses.

As far as Alexa not hearing you, I had no trouble at all but want to point out that Echo doesn't hear well in any environment with ambient noise because few devices can distinguish between background noise and voice command content and who can blame them?  Next, it doesn't hear well at a distance or in rooms that echo and/or conversely, have a lot of noise absorption.  Keep Echo close by or approach the general area where you keep your Echo.  I have mine near the couch/where we watch TV rather than in the kitchen or next to the iMac.  This seems to work best.

Finally, you should probably warn the text recipients that they'll be getting texts from an unfamiliar number.  Either include a text identifying both your name and that this is coming from Alexa, or send them a test text and have them save the number in their device as ""Xxxxx's Alexa"" or ""Xxxxx's Echo"", so they're not confused.

Developer.....perhaps you could add this as an option?  Either add the ability to enter the customized name of the Echo, the Amazon Acct holder's first &/or first and last name, the ability and option to send an ""introductory message"" with ""Hi, this is Xxxx's Amazon Alexa"" or something similar, along with your text about this being a 1-way conversation.",Perfectly executed skill and very handy!,1481760000,8.0,,1635

When you stump the interface, which is often, it won't stop asking if it can recommend something else . . . no matter what you say.

According to a Big Ass or Haiku representative, these fans are no longer able to link to WiFi if Xfinity (Comcast) is the provider and their router is used.. Comcast is the largest internet provider in the US so this should be a huge problem for Haiku. But the only suggestion that this elderly woman received was to go out and buy a new router to the tune of at least $150. Say what? Do you think I can install that myself? I seriously doubt it. So another large sum of money on top of new router. If this problem were apparent when I bought this fan, I would have returned it. After all there are many, much much cheaper, good looking fans out there. But I bought this one based on my ability to use voice commands.

We added quite a few pieces of automation pretty quickly, so it was kind of an adjustment. But when we added Alexa (Echo), it was nothing short of amazing. I can hardly remember what it was like before Alexa.

I find myself almost saying commands (to Alexa) when we are somewhere else, to turn on a light or something.  It is hard to remember what it was like before Alexa and UD ISY. My wife doesn't like me scolding her (Alexa) when she gets something wrong....

Just to be able to go to bed, and THEN tell Alexa to turn off all the lights is amazing.  When we leave the house, we just yell to her "" All lights off"". and the programs take care of the rest. Just amazing. I could go on, an on, but Alexa (Echo) brings it all together.

We were reluctant, because Alexa truly is...'listening all the time' (buffer). But if you can get past that, it is a completely different experience for home automation and the ISY platform. The voice recognition is incredible, and the ability to fine tune your settings in the Portal based on the History of what Alexa 'heard' you say, makes all the difference. We have a 'nook light' that we ask her to turn on and off, a lot.  She often thought I said 'milk light' so I just added 'milk light' to the list of verbal commands for the nook light and it works great.  Sometimes it is noisy and she doesn't get it right, but this solved that.

I look forward to Amazon improving Alexa in the coming years. I can only imagine.... Thank you UD for integrating Alexa. It has made a big difference at our house.",Simply Amazing,1493078400,10.0,,1630

Amazon is always working to improve integration of 3rd party skills into Alexa to reduce verbosity, but I am not sure if that includes task managers which Alexa has special handling for.

The first thing I noticed is the words that Alexa chooses for you to guess are fairly challenging.  This seems to make for a fun experience.. or at least it has so far!

About the only thing that I can think of that could be added.. might be an additional option to ask Alexa how many guesses you have left during the current game, before it ends.

EDIT: To those folks who mentioned in their reviews of this game, that the game will sometimes stop suddenly.

I believe this occurs when Alexa does not understand one of your responses during play.  And she appears to end the game abruptly after a couple of times occur when she doesn't get a response which she recognizes.

But the cool thing is that Alexa saves the current game (along with your progress) whenever this situation happens, (or if you choose to quit the game by asking her to quit or stop).

So you can always resume playing your current game.. by simply asking her to play Hangman again.

Doing this will allow you to continue a game in progress.

Dear hiku customers, I am writing to let you know that our company will be shutting down.

We have done everything possible to avoid this, but unfortunately that means that at the end of May the hiku service will turn-off and hiku will no longer work.

This is a company I started over six years ago to make grocery shopping easier for busy families. While the product has delighted many of you, including my own family, we have been unable to build a self-sustaining business or raise additional funds.

It is painful to shut the company down and disappoint you all, since I'm so very grateful for everyone in the hiku community. Nothing has brought our team more satisfaction than hearing about how hiku has helped your family or made your life a little easier.

So please know that we do no take this decision lightly, and have done everything in our power to find another outcome.

Thank you again for all your support throughout this journey, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

4,True,"09 2, 2013",A2VH2VXRR66823,B0058OQWH8,M. Campanell,"I'm happy with this order.  My goal was to get a bunch of Indian heads in one simple purchase online.  To get ten for under $20 through Amazon with free shipping was very convenient.  While I have no idea what the collector value of all the cents I got is, I do know the price per coin was less than many of the single Indian Heads up for sale on Amazon and Ebay.

The dates were:
1890, 1890, 1890, 1891, 1891, 1893, 1901, 1901, 1901, 1902

Each cent was in its own sleeve and graded.  The grades are from ""very good"" to ""very fine"".  I don't have the background to confirm whether the grades are exactly correct.  Some of the cents are definitely in great condition where you can see the fine details of the coin.

I cannot give the purchase 5 stars only because the webpage promised 10 unique dates and I received 5.  The duplicates do not bother me because my plan is to use the cents as gifts, each one to a different person.  But for somebody who is looking for variety, perhaps to start a set, might be disappointed with so many duplicates.  If it is too difficult to give every buyer 10 unique dates, the seller should say on the product page that there ""may be duplicate dates"", and perhaps offer an ""option"" to pay a few bucks extra for guaranteed unique dates, for those who really want it.",Very nice!!

You can clearly read all of the dates, and the coins aren't very worn down, but like I said, 5 of them had stains which I'm not too happy about.

Further, Wikipedia defines ""Mint State"" as a grade used in numismatics. It is given to a coin which was not used in circulation, and thus can be described ""as new"".

In modern-day United States numismatics, mint state coins are given a number from 60 to 70, with 70 being a perfect coin with no visible blemishes such as hits[jargon] or wear. Coins with a low grade, (60-63), although unworn, may suffer from weak striking, bag marks and other defects that make them less attractive to the collector. Some early coins appear quite worn in mint state, due to striking problems.

The coins I received are clearly in the lower category (60-63). Not really worth the price being charged, with water marks on each coin.",Uncirculated means...,1321488000,4.0,,919

The coins hold value in every state even culls are often taken by dealers because of the age and silver content.  I have been extremely happy with my purchase,  but I knew exactly what I was buying when I got it.
These are much better quality than the average cull ones often sold on Ebay and as I said;  they will hold their value.

Would it not effect your user experience if you were told it would arrive in 2-days with your Amazon Fire TV as an Amazon Prime member? I pay money yearly to get the products within the window I select. Nyko, and all indirect sellers, opt to place the shipping methods on their product as well.

I don't like getting told 2 days then having to wait more than 2 weeks later than when the product I purchased this for arrived. Do you?

The Nyko comes in a great price ($20) that I find reasonable. The PlayPad Pro has a 'soft-touch' plastic finish that feels nice in the hand and helps provide a nice 'grippy' feel. There build quality isn't great, but neither does it feel excessively cheap.

The d-pad and face buttons feel a little mushy but I did not have any issues with them becoming stuck or non-responsive. The thumb sticks and triggers had nice tension but a little more play than I would like, especially compared against 1st party console controllers. I think the ergonomics of the controllers felt a little cramped and reaching the top shoulder buttons a little difficult. But, I have large hands so this may be a non-issue for other users.

The controller paired easily with my Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 (2013) devices. I had no problem using it in any game that supported HID controllers. The biggest issue I had was with Nyko's Playground apps. I found these apps to be clunky, barely functional, and frequently crashing. Thankfully, you do not need the app to use the controller.

If you're playing games on there, and don't want to buy the official controller from Amazon, this is a viable alternative.  Just I urge you to pay attention to the instructions - mostly the ""Charge for two hours before trying to sync"".

The controller from the Xbox 360 has kind of spoiled me on all other controllers.  I just want to use that one on everything.  The Xbox One controller is mostly the same.  This is not BAD - not at all.  But I've gotten very used to the feel of the Xbox controller (not the original Xbox mind you - that was a monster).  So when I hold this it feels ""off"".  The ""feel"" of it is a bit wider in your hands, and the top part is taller.

It does feel nice when you hold it, though.  There' a nice rubber feel, which I actually do like a lot.  Makes it a lot more ""grippier"" than most game contollers, including my beloved Xbox controller.

I got this mostly because I wanted to try out the game controller stuff on my FireTV, and while I don't expect to play a lot of games there, it is nice to have a controller around.  This is a cheaper option than the official controller, so that's a positive.

I find that disappointing, because the Nyko Pro Commander controller for the Wii U, which looks similar, just seems more well made than this one. For a lack of a better word, it just kind of feels chintzy and loose (questionable build quality). Functionally, it works well enough, and after some initial issues getting it to charge (it took a long time in my case, but it did charge), it paired with my Fire TV easily and controls are responsive. I've used it with Heroes of Loot, Crazy Taxi and Fist of Awesome and it worked like a charm with no noticeable lag.

One thing that's instantly noticeable is that the PlayPad Pro lacks the heft of the stock Amazon Fire TV or the MadCatz C.T.R.L.R. If you're looking for a light controller, this might actually be a good thing, but between the lightweight feel and the charging issues, the PlayPad Pro seems half-baked and rushed to market (then again, the previous stock Android PlayPad Pro from Nyko also seems to have similar issues). The price-point might make it a decent option for a second controller, and when it works, it works well, but with some receiving units that are DoA or that need troubleshooting just to get them working, it's hard to recommend against other options, despite the lower price.","Works well enough, but feels a bit chintzy.

I had to follow the separate setup guide and not the main guide. The controller is fairly comfortable but not as nice as Sony's DS4. After casually playing about  an hour using this controller, my right hand started cramping. I am not sure if it is a typical adjustment period or an ergonomics issue.

Since it is compatible with other targets, I wanted to see how well it works. For other Android devices, it pairs and works OK. I tried it with my Nexus 4 phone and pairing is not a problem but getting it to work is a little dicey.

The Nyko PlayPad Pro fits the bill admirably - without too many frills - but it definitely works. I will need to update the review after I get a little more playing time on the controller - but so far it is pretty promising.

Notes-

- Pairing was relatively easy - just make sure you follow the included directions

- Charging takes about 2 hours and it should be done right out of the box

- The controller feels nice in your hand - it is ropuned and has a nice tacky rubberized feel - ideal for hands that may become a bit moist due to intense (sweaty) gameplay.

- In order to preserve he battery you will want to turn the controller off when not in use.

- In terms of navigating the Amazon Fire menus - the PlayPad Works ok - but it is not as easy the Amazon Fire native remote.

Given your typical 5 year old isn't Hercules, and I've seen him handle a dozen different controllers, tablets, and phones and their cables without reducing them to scrap, I find it hard to believe that this would not have otherwise quickly failed under even normal usage.

Well, yes and no. It's definitely functional as a game controller.  It sets up easy, for me at least.  Works fine. It's a little bit smaller and more rounded than the standard controller, which makes it a bit more comfortable. The rubber feel of the plastic is also nicer and it's lighter.  And it works fine in controlling games. Responsive and the buttons, pads, and sticks work fine. All that makes for a good alternative.

However, it lacks the standard controller's Fire TV specific buttons, buttons that allow the controller to fully function as a remote for other Fire TV tasks (except for the voice control).  The PlayPad is, after all, a basic controller that isn't designed for the Fire TV specifically.

This controller is rechargeable rather than having replaceable batteries, which sounds like a good idea, but I don't like it as much. The charge doesn't last as long, and it seems that the battery used internally allows the battery to discharge relatively quickly when not in use. So, whether you use this often or not, you'll be recharging it about the same amount of times.  Meanwhile, some eneloops or similar type rechargeable AA batteries for the regular controller have very, very little discharge when not in use and last a fair bit longer in general. So, it seems a cheaper quality battery is used here, and can't be replaced.

That means that when you do want to play, this controller will take a bit more attention, requiring recharges more frequently.  It works as a controller fine, but doesn't add any other functionality. On the other hand, the cost is much less. I'd say this would make a good choice as a second (or more) controller, but I know I'm glad I have the Amazon controller as well.",Functional controller for a lower cost,1405814400,,,1862

The controller comes with a power cable, a quick start sheet, and a folded, printed paper guide. I followed the instructions to charge for 2 hours (I left it over night) and then followed the simple instructions for pairing and setup. It did take a full 20 to 30 seconds for the Fire TV to find and pair, but it did so, and after that I was ready to test it out.

I tried it with several games, Riptide GP2, AirFighters Pro, etc. and everything worked great. The joysticks worked fine, I was able to perform as well in game as I do with the Amazon controller and all the buttons worked fine. The unit felt very comfortable in hand, with a nice rubberized texture. Everything worked as expected and I had no problems. It also worked fine as a remote control for viewing movies and other regular Fire TV uses. I did not notice any lag in response time, in gaming use, myself, as some have reported.

Clearly, the quality (and quality control, judging from earlier reviews) may not be up to the level of the much more expensive Amazon unit, but the PlayPad Pro I received seems fine, so maybe they have addressed some of these issues?  It also has the plus that you can switch and use it as a bluetooth mouse, IOS, or Android BT controller (not tested by me, yet anyway).

So, for the price asked, I think you are getting a pretty good deal. In game play, so far anyway, I have no complaints. We'll see how it holds up. I'll come back and update my review if I have any issues.

Then, following the extremely simple instructions, I paired it with my Amazon Fire TV. It found it quickly - taking less than a minute to pair. I was excited to find how easily and quickly everything went, but when I went to play a game, my enthusiasm lessened. When using the controller to play Zen Pinball HD, I found there is a slight delay from the time I pushed the button to the paddles on the screen moving. This made for some frustrating play. I didn't find as much of a problem when playing Minecraft - Pocket Edition, but the L and R buttons didn't always work.

The controller is easy to hold, but might be just a bit too small for the larger hand. It is light and it has a decent range. I do like that there are no wires to get tangled and it's quite easy to use. One thing I found was the buttons are not always consistent when going from game to game (no fault of the controller). The battery life was good and allowed for some long game play. To save on battery life, you can power down the PlayPad Pro by holding in the home button for 5 seconds or until the lights turn off.

Would I recommend this to family and friends. That depends. If you want a controller for a game where quick response time is necessary, then I'd say no. If you want just a controller to play games that don't depend on that time, then I would probably recommend it.

This was just as easy to set up as the one I had (simple, easier than pie). The XYAB buttons on the top right are slightly more visible on the Fire controller, because the letters are larger and on the button, and on the PlayPad Pro the buttons are the clear type with the letters inside them, so I give that to the Fire.

However, I like the feel of the PlayPad Pro more, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars, the same rating I gave the Fire controller. It has a soft rubber feel which is more comfortable to hold, as opposed to the regular slick plastic of the Fire controller.

The price is almost 1/2 of the Fire controller at this writing, so I'd definitely go with the less expensive one.

5,False,"07 13, 2014",A2SPI5WNZLOJ2U,B00J9P3KBS,Sal Nudo,"Nyko's PlayPad Pro Bluetooth controller is very easy to set up on Amazon Fire TV. The directions are easy to follow, and we had the controller ready to go in minutes.

This durable controller is very similar to the regular Amazon game-oriented controller built for Amazon TV. The main difference I noticed between the two controllers is that the Amazon controller has play/pause and forward/reverse buttons for TVs and movies, which aren't built into the Nyko controller. However, that's not a big deal in my opinion, given that the small controller that comes with Amazon TV is probably what most people would use to watch movies and TV shows anyway.

If you're a true gamer (which I'm not), you might appreciate the slightly better grip of the Nyko controller versus the Amazon one. The Amazon controller is made of smoother plastic, whereas Nyko's controller has a stickier grip. This is a minor difference, but people who play lots of video games might appreciate it.

Both controllers are exactly the same in terms of the buttons and the function of the joysticks. Each can control non-video game elements of Amazon TV, though again, the Amazon controller contains the pause/play and forward/reverse functions while the Nyko controller does not.

The Nyko controller comes with a charger cord and it charged very quickly the first time. I'm not sure how long the charge lasts, but we've used the controller steadily for a few weeks without having to recharge it.

I was surprised to see that the Nyko Playpad Pro also functions with tablets and smartphones. We haven't used it for those devices, but that's a good option to have.

For those who play video games on Amazon TV, it's worth noting that players can help each other out on the same game using two controllers, since these items run on Wi-Fi using the same connection. It makes the video game experience more collaborative and fun. Of course, the two controllers can also be used individually to take turns on two-player games.

Finally, though we haven't used it, this controller has a Nyko Playground App tool that allows you to create a customized profile and use the controller with advanced configurations. The Playground app must be downloaded to do this.

Overall, this is a really quality controller that we have no complaints about.",Playpad Pro is easy to set up and use ... definitely recommended,1405209600,4.0,,2306
5,False,"07 11, 2014",AGJRUK27RBVYS,B00J9P3KBS,Ivy Reisner,"I paired it with my Fire TV and it works perfectly.

Pairing is very simple, and the included instructions are perfectly clear.

If you prefer a rechargeable controller, this is the going to fit that bill perfectly.  I've used it about 18 hours so far on one charge with no problem.  For what it's worth, I plugged it into the Kindle Fire charger before I went to bed and just left it plugged in all night, so I'm sure it started with a full charge.  I kind of doubt the recommended two hours is going to be enough, particularly since different chargers put out different amperage).  I suspect undercharging it that would lead to battery problems, similar to the ones discussed here.

It is the same size as the Fire controllers, which is awesome for kids or women or people with small hands, but might be a bit on the small size for folks with larger hands.

This is meant to be a generic controller for Android devices, which cuts both ways.  If you want a controller that can work on your Fire and your tablet, you're in luck.  However, because it is generic, it doesn't have the specialized media buttons on the bottom (play, pause, forward, rewind, etc) that the Fire game controller does.

I am definitely enjoying it.",Works very nicely,1405036800,,,1224

4,True,"04 28, 2014",A1RVPYZXFV333D,B00J9P3KBS,ND Mike,"Original 1 star review:

Mine is DOA. No lights when charging. 6 hours and nothing. Occasionally when plugged in you get a little flicker on the HID light. If not no flicker.

The packaging is nearly identical to the older version. The main difference is the UPC and the older packaging has the Tegra 3 logo on the back of the outer sleeve. The part numbers are the same, but the Fire TV model shows 2.4GHz and the older shows 20MHz on the working frequency if that helps anybody who wasn't sure they got the correct pad.

UPDATE 4/29/14

I tried every port and USB charger I had. Finally last night I tried an old USB wall charger. It was 5v 100mAh from a MP3 player. Still nothing. I forgot I had left it connected. This afternoon I was going to box it up and send it back and when I went to get it it was still connected to the charger and all the LED were flickering frantically. The pad wasn't hot so I decide to leave it on and about 40 minutes later I went back and the LED for charging was on like it was supposed to do. I paired it to the Fire TV and it worked. I used it for awhile then disconnected it from the charger. It stayed on so I powered it off and connected it to my PC and it started charging.

I think what happened is either the batteries never got an initial charge in the factory or maybe were allowed to run completely during testing of the gamepad. I have had other tablet that going to a lower amp charger brought them back so possible that is what happened here.

I would suggest that if your gamepad does not initially respond or gets the crazy lights when you first plug it in, leave it on. Initially I went almost 6 hours with no results so long as the pad isn't getting warm leave it on. Since I don;t know when the lights started flickering I do know it was on the charger a little over 12 hours. If you have a lower amp older USB charger give that a shot as well. But they do have to be charged out of the box, even if they will power up.

It does perform exactly like the older Play Pad Pro on the Fire TV. The menu button will not launch Bard's Tale and the steering if off in Carmaggedon and in Riptide GP2.

Over all with it working it is a decently built controller, but with some issues.

So why 4 stars instead of 3 or even 2? First with the cheap price I don't have a big problem with having to put in a little effort to get something to work. So that was 3 stars for me once it got working. The 4th star is because Amazon read my review and called me to assist with troubleshooting and/or replacing.

4,False,"02 20, 2016",A3PK3C1J8P23PO,B017UPWIR0,BobbyRed,"This is another Amazon Fire TV power adapter introduced by Mission Cables.  The idea behind these power adapters is to tidy up your  entertainment system by using the USB port on a TV to power the Amazon Fire TV (AFTV).  This configuration will eliminate the need of a  power cord coming from an AC outlet thus freeing up an AC outlet.

This device is compatible with the 2nd generation AFTV's only.  Note:  the power connectors on the  1st & 2nd gen AFTV's are different.  Another important prerequisite is that the TV must have a USB port with 5vdc @ 1000ma (1a) output.  This device will not work on TV's having a legacy 5vdc 500ma output.

I installed this unit on 4 of 6 HDTV's I own but could not get it to perform as designed.  Apparently my TV's which are a little older do not have the required current carrying capacity.  I then passed the adapter on to a friend who reported the adapter worked on all 3 of his TV's: a recent Sony, recent Samsung and an older Sanyo.  I also lent the device to another fiend who reported back that the device worked great on his Sharp Arquos model.  Both individuals advised  that their AFTV's launched smoothly, streamed media smoothly without any hesitation or pixellation.  One individual praised the device so much, I let him keep it.

Mission Cable's Power Adapter for the 2nd generation AFTV does work as designed.  However, one must ensure that their TV's USB port has a 1000ma output.  This is not an easy specification to find in a user's manual.  I would suggest contacting your TV's manufacturer before purchasing this device.",Clean Up Your AFTV Equipment Configuration With This Power Adapter,1455926400,,,1580

A vault is just a place to store something.  The password is just meant to be a minor deterrent to the casual user of your phone.

I wonder if those that lost their photos really lost them or if the app just started looking in a different location and they were unable to find them or if their FAT table became corrupted, for I find it hard to believe that the writers of the software would intentionally delete any files unrelated to the app itself.

All this does is rename the file name extension of your photos so that other ""photo"" viewer apps do not think that those files are photos to be viewed.

I have a large variety of photos on my phone.  Kids, family, events, serial numbers, comparison shopping, documentation, articles to be viewed later.

Those first three want to be seen my friends and family, but the latter do not and this allows me to easily keep those latter photos out of the Android Gallery app, but still available to me.

Pros: highly intuitive, convenient to use
Cons: the app hides folders and individual pics by holding down the respective thumbnails for a couple seconds.

This app merely moves and renames the image files.  It doesn't provide any sort of encryption, so I wouldn't recommend it for anything that could get you into trouble if it were discovered.  Anyone who removes the MicroSD card from your phone and plugs it into a PC can search through the folders on it and find the pictures.  Some file manager apps can also display the images on the device (OI File Manager, for instance, will actually display thumbnails if you navigate to the ""hidden"" folder).

Your pictures are given a random numerical filename with the extension .pss (6060842.jpg.pss, for instance) and moved into the folder /PssInc/Vault/.Data.  If you copy that file to your computer and remove the .pss extension (6060842.jpg, for example), or use an appropriate file manager on your device, you can view the picture normally.

This app does NOT work with files stored on a MicroSD card on the Motorola Xoom, and probably other Honeycomb tablets.  That is because the card is mounted as read-only by the Honeycomb OS.  (I'm not sure whether this is an issue with ICS.)

When I first ran it, it crashed.  In fact, I tried a few times and ""Force Close"" every time.  That is my only negativity but rebooting my Android seemed to get it out of its funk.  It's work great since.

Transferring files from ""Public"" to ""Private"" was a piece of cake.  In fact, it is so easy that it will sometimes swap them back and forth just by holding your finger on the screen too long.  But it will at least warn you that it has swapped the setting.

So what is the difference from a file standpoint?  Basically, the files are moved to another location on the SD card, the name and extension is changed, and the file structure is scrambled.  So your photos are secure, as they should be.

I actually find that I enjoy this more than the Android built-in photo viewer, mostly because it generates the thumb-nails faster than the Android photo view does.  So I still use PhotoVault even for non-private photo viewing.

Another thing I like is how easily and quickly it finds the photos on your SD card.  As soon as you get into the app it already has your photos ready to be viewed, even those newly added to your card.  I thought the transfer process would take a long time but it moved 300 photos to the private side of things all within a minute.  I would expect it to take much longer than that.

My only complaint, other than the ""force closes"" that occurred at first but hasn't repeated, is that when you zoom into a photo it will go to a new photo if you pan to the left or right.  It doesn't wait for you to get to the edge of the photo so if you are trying to look at something on the sides of the photo it will change to the next or previous picture.  I really  hope they fix this sometime.

Pros:
You're able to hide photos, as stated.

Cons:
- You can use Vaulty to do this for free. As well as a gallery app like QuickPic, which is free, allows you to hide photos as well, and it's FREE..and a much better gallery app overall. which is my major complaint with this app. Charging money for what other free apps do better, should be a crime.
- Can't hide videos, they have a seperate app for that.
- Can still view ""hidden"" photos, using file manager apps.
- look of app is pretty outdated, like seriously..what is up with that first screen where you set the password and/or login, looked like a website from 1998.

Should you buy?
Not unless you have a strong need to hide very specific photos, AND you're lazy.

I suggest downloading QuickPic, you're able to hide directories, so if you're taking the pics that need hidden, use a different 3rd party camera app for those and set the custom directory to your hidden one. Or set up a folder using a your chosen file manager app, hide it, and move any photos you'd like to hide into that folder. If you're really worried about people seeing pictures/videos that you don't want them too, and NEED to spend money to feel good about that. Something like App Protector Pro I think is a better route. Locks specific apps, so I could lock file manager app and gallery app, and without a pattern i set people will not be able to get into my stuff. But since people like to pass their phones around, use the quickpic idea I outlined above, or try Vaulty.

I am using a Samsung Galaxy Note II (model SH-I605) running Android 4.1.2. I am not sure it's the hardware or software because my carrier - Verizon - locks down root access on these phones and the app may be denied access that it needs to perform. The fault most likely lies with Verizon and their rather customer-unfriendly policies regarding phones running on open systems software. But for the rest of you this is a slick piece of software that I had the pleasure of putting through its paces on a different phone from a carrier that 'gets it'.

Quick overview is this has some built in intelligence that lets you know what it can and cannot do and offers suggestions regarding apps to move. Folks who purchase larger SD cards will find this to be very useful (I have a 64gb in my phone.) One note: this is not for moving static files like music and the such. For that I use an app called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SD-Card-Manager/dp/B004Z2UF2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SD Card Manager</a>, which is essential for folks who purchase a lot of MP3 albums from Amazon because the Amazon cloud software for Android will put downloads on your phone's internal memory ignoring external cards.

I realized and figured out and now just tested the solution to the question mark in the battery icon. I had downloaded Dr. Web anti-virus which seems to be the root of the problem. How this problem develops is beyond me.

I had installed this app on my kindle Fire and my wife's Kindle Fire as well. About a week later my wife complained that her kindle was unresponsive (black screen and appeared to lose power on a full battery) and could not use the Fire unless it was constantly plugged in. I blew her off and figured she did something she wasn't supposed to and removed the app while it was plugged in because she doesn't use the internet function on the browser. About a month later the same problem happened to me. I had removed the app through the website and immediately came home and removed the app entirely from my device while it was plugged in due to losing all functionality the night before. I then powered my kindle off, turned it back on while it was plugged in but to no avail. I then did a hard reset and presto, no more question mark in the battery icon, no more problems.

I then did a search on this matter and found other users complained of the same problem with their Kindle Fires. It was only then once a replacement was sent the individuals preformed a hard reset, and everything worked as it should, leading me to believe that once the app was gone, the functionality was restored. The additional information from other users can be found here:

http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx22I1E6YFASYEK

I could be wrong in my assumptions, simply because I ran the App for a couple of months without a problem. Nonetheless, this problem is worth looking into. I went ahead and referred my feedback to Amazon and hopefully they will look into this. In the mean time, I welcome all comments for users to share their experience with this app. I honestly hope that I am wrong in my assumptions so no other individual has to deal with this inconvenient problem.

My final thoughts:

I believe it's a decent app but has some compatibility issues with other apps. You can probably use it just fine if you leave the ""guard"" off and just run scans manually. I gave it three stars because it should work fine if it isn't running all the time. It's lightweight and doesn't use much memory.  It scans quickly.

I had unsuccessfully tried so many things to fix it, I was ready to conclude it had a hardware problem. I was going to try a factory reset (did I ever loathe that option), and then my otherwise-outstanding tablet was heading for eBay, to be sold ""as is."" I used the Advanced Fix under Wi-Fi Problems in Wi-Fi Connection Manager's menu, it wiped my collection of saved networks and passwords, (I think) reinstalled my Android Wi-Fi drivers and software, and for the past week my network connection and internet have been rock solid and fast.
The problem I'd had was very frequent disconnects from the internet. I couldn't stay online for even 20 minutes without a glitch. In Settings, my network always appeared connected, but my various browsers, TuneIn Radio, and any other Wi-Fi-dependent apps would say I was not connected to the internet, and would act accordingly. After a little time -- 1 minute, or maybe 3 minutes, or 5 -- I would be connected again.
I restarted the tablet, of course, multiple times. I tried Safe Mode, which helped just a little. I changed settings on my router. I removed apps I thought might be causing problems. I checked my tablet's sleep and Wi-Fi advanced settings. I tried other apps -- Wi-Fi Fixer and Wi-Fi Keep Aliv -- and those didn't help.
I got this app on Google Play, but I refuse to have a Google+ account, so I can't review it there.

You can get a cellular signal nowadays almost anywhere so your cellular devices are practically always connected to the net. However, cellular networks charge you for the data your devices use so these plans can be very expensive and or limited.

This particular app allows for people like me,  with Wi-Fi only tables,  to have something closed to that persistence that cellular networks have but for much more less and with unlimited potential. See, cable provider, who is also my regular ISP, offers me free WiFi access to all their many Wi-Fi antennas located all over the city plus as an extra, they also offer me free access to all the antennas from all the other competing cable providers as well. (This is something they all do; let their users share Wi-Fi access.). By using an app like this one I can instruct my Kindle to be proactive and to keep me connected to the best available Wi-Fi signal out of my extensively available list, which not only includes all of the above, but any other free open antenna I can find and add to that list. The app does the work of keeping me always connected. I just need to keep adding antennas to the list. Not a bad trade-off for I don have to worry about cellular overages or about the cellular company restricting me due to my rate of usage of their bandwidth.

I even have a cellular hotspot for the rare occasions I am found myself in a blind Wi-Fi area. The hotspot of course just act as another Wi-Fi antenna that I turn on only as I needed it and that is also part of my list of available Wi-Fi connections at a high priority level, just below my home's and work's  antennas. Every Wi-Fi only device should have an app like this. I even went with the 200 talk minutes plan 5Gb data plan with my cell phone, for $30 a month, and I have the unlimited talk plan from Skype, for $30 per year  So between my mobile internet, texting and voice I only pay about $400 per year!. (Not adding my home ISP/VOIP/Cable TV service that somewhat afford me to do what I do by giving me access to their extensive network of Wi-Fi antennas. Anyway, I paid about $200 per month for these services but I get unlimited home VOIP, high speed internet at home, their higher, and with the gold channel package I get all their cable channels plus on-demand and online TV, I can watch most of the premium channels over the internet from anywhere.). This is not an advertisement for cable tv. It is just that this particular app serves me as the glue to keep my Wi-Fi access as persistent as anything any cellular company can offer me but basically without all the extra cost.",A must for tablets with no cellular services,1425772800,4.0,,2771

(Wife & daughter have iPhones) You can set it up like I did: both a ""DVR Internet"" for the WAN (read: access from the outside world) or ""DVR WiFi"" for the local LAN. As long as your router's IP stays static, you can access the cameras from anywhere. I have a Bunker Hill (Harbor Freight) 8 channel security DVR. Setting it up wasn't that hard.

Unfortunately: the IP Cam Viewer is not fulfilling the purpose for which I bought it. I bought this as a camera to keep an eye on the house when away - however, the camera does not work when not on our home network/wifi.  So basically, you can't view it from outside the house. I've even had a friend who is an IT professional come to help me figure this out and no luck still.  To call the help desk is an additional fee (almost equivalent to the cost of the camera). I'd rather buy a new camera that works from outside the home and allows me to monitor while on a different wifi network.  Additionally, the microphone feature on the camera doesn't work well - the noise is so faint you can't hear it.  The camera is also quite large/bulky, which isn't a detracting feature for me but may be for some.  Lastly, it lacks certain features that other monitors/cameras have (ie ability to tell room temperature).",Install is complicated and doesn't work off network,1389398400,,,1114

If your Kindle had a camera it would already have an app to use it. Use your brains! Also, if you don't know how to set up ip cameras, there are thousands of websites on the internet where you can learn how to do it. And don't forget to look up port forwarding for your router while you're at it, you will need to do that too.

Now as far as this app goes, I had the max of six cams working in just a few minutes. The app seems stable so far. The only things I don't like is the squeezing and stretching of the picture depending on which way you hold the Kindle, and the frame refresh rate is VERY, VERY SLOW (less than one frame every five seconds). The frame refresh rate needs to be fixed. I have Tinycam Monitor Pro, and the frame refresh rate on that app is VERY good, the cames refresh at a rate of between 3 and 9 frames per second. If you're trying to watch for theft or vandalism (on ip cam viewer), you'll miss a lot in 5 seconds. I would not trust this app for anything more than just getting snapshots off your cams. I think it's a good start, but it certainly needs more work.

In my case, the Zmodo system uses port 18004 for remote access and that had to be opened on my router's firewall. The app will also recommend a port if you select the correct camera/DVR maker and model number.

6/15/2012 - Been a while since I paid for the 'Full' version of this app. It works great. Updates have addressed cam control, viewing, and 2-way sound. I still like it. It works great on my Fire.  I have tested it from various 'outside' connections and the connection - using my DDNS - has been flawless. My inside cam is easily controlled with the PTZ and returns to the default position at a touch. All cams displays are easily changed upside down, 90-degree, reversal, etc., to adjust for camera mounting. Sound is Not good in 2-way comm.

Unfortunately, it often leads to not following up with the fee version.

Anyway, the app does *everything* it promises... from a very comprehensive list of traffic cams (which in and of itself is worth the fee), to being able to access your own home/business IP cams.  There is loooong list of camera vendors and cameras, and you should be able to find your specific model rather easily.  The setup for the model I have installed (Panasonic BL Series) was simple and succinct, and I was up and running in, literally, less than three minutes from install.  You do NOT need to be an IT guru to set up a port forwarding for your camera on your home/business router.  It is NOT rocket-science.

The app allows you to view individual cams, or can put you in Matrix view, which allows multiple cams on a single screen. It also allows recording, however, that is NOT defaulted always-on, as suggested by some other reviews.  You can also do single shot captures.  The app is intuitive, and not difficult at all to find your way around in.  There are additional menus which allow you to invoke all the features of your cam, including pan, tilt, sound, zoom, preset positioning, etc., as well as inverting your screen, reversing pan/tilt, select image quality over refresh speed, etc.

That being said I found myself in search of an app I could use to adequately illuminate my screen so that I could read hardcore books (ordered from Amazon.com) at night.  I found the free version of this app and immediately purchased the pro version.  The pro version only removes ads, but supports the developer.  This app works great.  Other apps that use the main screen for a flashlight, night light or reading light were not bright enough or I had to exit the app to adjust overall screen brightness.  This app has everything I was looking for in a simple reading light with the added bonus of a great user interface!  The added bonus of being able to use another color other than white really helps set the mood and eases eye strain while reading (I use a light cyan type color when reading).  While I haven't used it yet, being able to set a timer to shut off the app will come in handy in the case of falling asleep with the app on (to save battery life).

The app is worth every penny of the $1.99 I paid for it.  Check out the free version if you are unsure, but like I did you will most likely just want the small add space in the bottom to disappear as soon as possible.

I've tried other cheaper, or free, apps for this purpose and the only thing I'll say about them is that their developers knew what they were worth.  This app may seem a bit pricey but it is well worth the cost.  It is simple to setup and easy to use.  The gTablet screen is 1024x600, that is the size of screen shot the app produces and they look just like what the screen was displaying.  That may seem like an obvious statement, but I can't say this about the other apps I've tried.  By setting the delay timer it's possible to take shots of even games as they are running.  They have a free app available to access screenshots taken on a  phone but, since I'm using this on my gtablet, I did not download it and can't comment on it's use.

To get this app to work you have to 1) go to another website to purchase it [not Amazon] so that it can be downloaded to your PC, 2) install two other programs (dropbox and screenshot it enabler), as well as complicated worarounds to install a USB driver on the Kindle (this alone took me 2 hours).

I first installed dropbox so I could move the app from my PC to my Kindle. (See Chris Crossen's product review comments)

Then, I followed these instructions to install the USB driver on the CNET site, how to take screenshots on the kindle fire page: [...]

Then, I had to install Screenshot It Enabler, and restart my PC to get THAT to work.

After all of that, the app did work.  But I could not take screenshots in DRAW SOMETHING, which is the only reason I personally bought the app.

Frustrated, I continued on with the ""Take Screenshots"" section of the CNET link above (which will probably be removed when I post this comment.  Go to howto cnet dot com, and then the ""how to take screenshots on the kindle fire"" page.)

At last I could take screenshots IF my Kindle was connected to my PC and IF I started the ddms.bat file AFTER I was on the Draw Something screen I wanted a screenshot of.

Recommended.

This adds low-end range adjust-ability to the HDX's excellent display.

Without LL, the Kindle Fire HDX (7 in) at lowest settings is too bright (for me) to use in very low light situations.
Eye strain usually hit me after 15 minutes of reading in a dark environment with the lowest setting and the text-page lighting reversed (white text on black page). Imagine sitting a foot or so away from your main flat screen and reading text even with the brightness turned down.

With LL, I read without the strain.

One drawback is that it only senses two touches, one of the few other drawbacks was that the screen couldn't be dimmed beyond a certain point, which was brighter than I needed and (I assumed) used a lot of the battery. I didn't know that a utility could dim the display further, so I was happy to give this one a try. I was surprised to see a slight difference as soon as the program started, and it has been working fine since. There are a number of useful settings. Very nice to be able to dim the display when I'm reading in the dark, so I don't spoil my night vision.

Ever since I cannot power-up my tablet again. I tried recharging the tablet and it would not take charge I am patiently waiting all I am seeing is tablet refuses to power-up.

THERE IS SOME SERIOUS incompatibility with this app and ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch model ME173x.

Stay clear of this APP. I am not kidding. ""Danger, Will Robinson!"" Danger!

EDIT: Jan 31, 2014
-------------------
I am not new to Android OS but even with all that knowledge It took me considerable amount of time to recover my ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch model ME173x. Here is the rundown of the problem and how to recover from this incompatible app.

As this APP installs with ""Start At Boot"" option and whatever 'lowest' value of ""1"" Brightness you set seems to trigger a serious battery drain on ASUS ME173x, I cannot explain what would have triggered such a phenomenon as 'user' apps like these cannot really change system wide setting to an extent that it would make the tablet unusable.

My theory is that ASUS might somehow not allow user to lower the brightness below a certain 'threshold' value because they know what would happen if you go below certain limit due to ""hardware design"" or a known limitation, This app on the other hand might have triggered a value which override that safe 'value' set by the manufacturer and caused serious battery drain to shutdown the OS in mere 5 mins of using the app. I think it could very well be a ASUS firmware issue which gets manifested by this app inadvertently in the efforts to lower the brightness.

The problem is complex for novice users because of this app is set to ""Start At Boot"" it would immediately activate that 'unsafe low' value of brightness and causes the tablet to power-off instantly due to low battery warning. BTW, When you have a battery that is lower than 1% OS cannot start. The Hardware attempts to charge the battery but when user activates the OS the app drains the battery and you end-up in a perpetual mess.

The way I was able to recover is to let the battery discharge completely to a point wherein even by pressing the power button no display comes on. Then charge to 100% without really powering up the device (Let the AC adapter connected for 3-4 hours) Then powered up the tablet and kept the supplied AC charger connected to the tablet and immediately delete the APP. Shutdown the Tablet as quickly as possible and then followed these critical steps:

Press and hold Power until the device powers on, then immediately press and hold Volume_UP (while still pressing Power). You will see the Boot Menu. Now 'VOLUME_UP' button will act as the select Key and VOLUME_Down as the 'OK' key. Press Volume_Down twice to designate 'Recovery mode'. Press Volume_Down key after selecting 'recovery' to restart into Recovery mode. You will see an image of an Android robot with a red exclamation mark. Press the Power button and you will see 'Android system recovery' menu.

Use the Volume_Down key to scroll to ""wipe cache partition"" and press Volume_UP to select it. It will display --""Wiping Cache""... ""Formatting Cache""... and will display ... ""Cache Wipe Complete"".. and it will automatically move the cursor selection to ""Reboot System now"" option. Press Volume_UP button and reboot your tablet.

From now on the traces of this poorly designed app is gone and your tablet will perform normally.","""Danger, Will Robinson!"" Danger!",1391040000,,,3658

The app lets you establish lighting levels and remembers them for future use. So, the manual adjustments don't always have as much options as are available in this app. I also like being able to set the light levels and have the app remember them.

However when I use it in daylight I cant see the screen. I usually use a free program called ""Advanced Brightness"" off the Google play store.

Compared to that program the menus and controls of ""low light"" seem quite a bit fussier then I prefer. I did like the ability to adjust brightness in steps - that is a clever design right there! However that is matter of preference. If you find the automated brightness adjustment of your tablet or phone does not suit you and you like the controls then this program is clearly worth the fee.

I took one star off since the program has a fatal flaw so serious the programmer warns you about it. You see you can set the brightness so low that the phone is not usable in bright light. The program could use a panic feature - like swipe three fingers in a zig zag or what ever to set max brightness.

4,True,"01 30, 2014",A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B006ZAY5GY,Brent Butler,"The possible primary advantage of using Low Light over the native brightness control is that Low Light gives you a numerical designation to go with a particular level of brightness. So if you do prefer the brightness at different levels for different apps or lighting conditions, you can remember your ""preferred number"" rather than just an approximate spot on a slider.

I only deduct a star from this app because while it does exactly what it claims, I just don't know of how much use that will be to me.

Also, strange things happen if for some reason you decide to try to use the device's built in brightness scale at the same time as this app. It seems that when using the device's brightness control your range on the preview is from completely dimmed to the current brightness level chosen in Low Light. However, when you exit the brightness control, the level at which you left the slider overrides Low Level's setting to become your new brightness. That is, the odds are your screen will be brighter after you exit the brightness control than the preview you saw.
I'd recommend that you use one or the other, and not try to use both controls when using Low Level.

Further, Low Level's setting appears to be overridden by the Kindle if you have auto-brightness turned on in the Kindle's brightness settings. In short, the two don't play well together.

I'm not particularly bothered by my Kindle Fire's higher brightness levels for virtually everything I use it for. The one exception to that is using it for reading, where I much prefer the eInk Kindles. This app DOES assist in fine tuning a reduced screen brightness for reading from the Kindle app. After some trial and error I settled on a setting of 12 as my preference for that activity. Reducing brightness makes my reading on the Fire more comfortable, but the nature of the glass screen also accommodates a good bit of reflection. I don't seem to notice that reflection under normal circumstances, but I seem to notice it constantly while reading no matter what the screen brightness is. Also, while the background is dimmed, so is the text. I had to increase the text size to accommodate for that effect.

I think this is a very useful app to have handy just in case we need it. Only a lot more experience will prove just how often those needs arise.

Another caution that led me to hold back a star is that I did have an unexpected reboot of the Fire (an HD 8.9) on one attempt to launch the app. I'll update the review to report if that happens again or not. I don't get unexpected reboots on this device, which made me suspicious of why it just occurred when I tapped Low Light to launch it.

The app doesn't have intrusive permissions.

It does activate when you reboot the device, as I noticed after my unexpected reboot. LOL So it is a self-launching background process. The settings allow you to specify if you want it to activate on wake ups and reboots, and usefully also allows you to set the minimum brightness setting allowed.

As a note for the devs, it would useful if you could specify distinct brightness levels by app, or alternatively provide a number of settings where the user could define a brightness level and a label for that level. The setting I might use to read in the Kindle app is not a setting I'd probably want to use with any other app. A feature like that would help to further separate your app from the regular brightness control.

About three months ago, I stopped making excuses and started trying to get healthy. It started with diet and walking but soon I decided to try more. C25K does exactly what it says, it makes it easy for a couch potato to get started. I did find that I repeated the first five weeks (did each week twice) but by week six I was able to keep going.

If you have music downloaded on your phone, you can listen to it directly through C25K without needing to open additional apps. If you listen to streaming music, you will need to open it separately. When the app speaks to you, your music will dim slightly so you can hear the voice telling you what to do.

My only compliant about the app is that when you do repeat a workout, it doesn't track both dates. It will only show the last time you completed the workout. In the apps defense, it does warn that records will be erased if you repeat, but I still want it to record it for me. I'm going slower than C25K's estimated distance but I'm not stopping to walk so I call it a win. For example, C25K says jog 2.5 miles in 25 minutes but in the 35 minutes (including the warm up and cool down) I only went two miles.

I did pay the $1.99 to upgrade the app because it said it would track, but it just adds distance and calories counts, not tracking multiple attempts. It also removes advertising. Also, the distance and calories might not be accurate. I was using a different GPS based app to track calories and the two were off by about 100 calories. Additionally, C25K syncs workouts to MyFitnessPal but the reported calories differs as well. So I'm not sure which count is correct.

I just purchased Zen Lab's 10K app to continue from C25K. When the app downloaded, it starts from week nine where C25K left off. So If you're thinking of eventually upgrading, I recommend skipping C25K and going straight to their 10K app. The first eight weeks are identical. If you don't plan to go past jogging for a half hour, then C25K is a good system.",it makes it easy for a couch potato to get started,1474934400,2.0,,2087

I do wish that it tracked your distance though. It has you walk/run for a half an hour but that doesn't mean that you end up actually running a 5k at the end.  You end up running for a half an hour. So I open both this app and a gps running app at the same time, to get my distance. I'm not sure if the paid version measures distance or not, but it is easy to work around with a second free app. I also want to add that I use this app on a blackberry z10 and have had no issues.","A great running program for all levels or runners, or runners to be!",1470009600,,,745

The ""C25K - 5K Trainer Run for Pink"" app is a slick little timer that incrementally adjusts the intensity of your workout each day that it is used.  This gradual increase allows you to safely progress from couch potato to 5K runner in just a few weeks.  But while it is a great timer, I think it needs some more bells and whistles (like workout diary and motivation alerts) to make it a truly exceptional.

I am testing this app on a Kindle HD and these are my impressions...

** Pros **

The app has some slick looking graphics.  It uses bold colors against a black background that are really easy to see and use.  (But note to developers: on my Kindle the red, green, blue, and orange progress ribbon on circular dials are misaligned with the ""track"".  At the top of the dial the colored progress ribbon is about 1/4  inch from the edge of the silver dial, and at the bottom of the dial the colored ribbon sits on top of the silver dial.)

The verbal alerts are loud and clear and work even when the Kindle is in sleep mode.

You can play music during the workout and still hear the verbal alerts.

The workout level gradually increases as you progress through the days.

** Cons **

There is no ability to take notes after the workout is finished.  It would be nice to enter info on how the workout made you feel, and track you progress through the weeks.  I know the app lets you post stuff on Facebook and Twitter, but I don't want my workout information posted to either venue.

There is no motivational component to the app.  If you are not playing music it would be nice for the voice to give you periodic pep talks.  Things like ""you are doing great, only 30 seconds more...""

The app also needs more progress prompts, especially if you are not playing music.  The verbal prompts tells you when to start running, walking and cool down, but it doesn't interact in between.  It needs verbal prompts telling you which walk/run round you are on.  Something like ""You are starting  round 4 out of 5"".

Can't use in landscape mode.  I use the treadmill so I would like to use my cover's built in stand.

** Final Thoughts **

As mentioned earlier, this is a great app to use while running outside or on a track, but if you exercise on a treadmill it doesn't offer any advantages over the treadmill's built in timers/programs.  And while app is a slick little timer that adjusts the intensity of workout each successive day that it is used, I think it needs some more bells and whistles (like workout diary and motivation alerts) to make it a truly exceptional.","Good timer, but no motivation or record keeping options",1366416000,14.0,,2734

One note/complaint: the app lets you look at a list of connected devices, but it won't let you see their IP addresses.  Instead, you are given the MAC address of each device.  However, if you really need to access that information, you can always opt to connect to your router by entering its IP address into your device's web browser.

I guess it should be considering this company (Neomedia) has been developing this technology before most people were aware of QR codes. Cell phone camara resolution had to improve over the years just to catch up with Neomedia's vision. Matter of fact they own many of the core patents. Any company that wants to engage in the mobile marketing sector will have to sign up with NEOM. Microsoft just signed up. That appears to have opened the flood gates, with in days a couple more companies jumped on board. No doubt Amazon, Google, Apple, Facebook & many others will probably sign up so as not to be left out of the rush to mobile marketing. Who can blame them? NeoReader is blazing the trail with this killer app in what will prove to be the hottest sector in marketing in years to come.

Works like a charm. All you do is aim your cell phone at a product's QR code, bar code or in some cases simply aim it at the product & it will pull up all up to date info on the item including the location & best prices.

The touch controls make it too easy to accidentally add a lap, which could easily throw the stats off.  But this app doesn't need external interference to give faulty statistical data - it does this all by itself, just as others have noted.  Additionally, the app does NOT consider the ""stop"" to be the end of a lap.  Seriously?

I was fully prepared to give this app three or four stars, knowing that these errors were likely due to the app not being completed in time for its FAOTD slot.  (This fact is obvious on its own).

I am going to ""play"" with it a bit more - but so far it has been frustrating to the point of being unusable for me.

I admit that I do not want or need a stopwatch, so I can't comment on that functionality.  All I wanted was a simple timer. When I saw this as the FAOTD I downloaded it immediately.

I guess that most of my issues with the app have to do with the way the settings work (or don't).  And many of my issues have to do with the fact that almost all of the settings do *not* default to anything close to what I want, and my changes to the settings have gotten wiped out (everything reset to the defaults) every time the app has crashed - which has been at least a half-dozen times in the last hour.

First, it seems strange that the way you switch between the app functioning as a stopwatch or as a timer is by changing a setting.  It, of course, defaults to stopwatch.  So that's the first setting that I have to keep re-changing, every time the app crashes.

At one point when I started a timer a voice kept announcing the amount of time left - like every 30 seconds... Not something you want to listen to, if you have a timer set for 3 hours!  So I went in and looked at all the other settings.  There are several settings for Voice and Vibration Prompts under the heading of ""Stopwatch Settings"".  Turns out these also apply to the Timer...  So, a bad heading... not the end of the world...

But if you look at the ""Select Voice Prompt"" choices, they are:  ""Never"", ""20 seconds"", ""30 seconds"", ""1 minute"", and ""Custom"".  The default value is ""30 seconds"" - which as I said, doesn't make any sense for long timers.  If the default were ""Never"" it wouldn't be so bad. But given that my changes to the Settings keep getting cleared, you have to keep resetting this. (and the ""Vibration Prompt"" - though I don't have any Vibration on my tablet.)

If you wanted to actually set a prompt longer than 1 minute, the ""Custom Prompt Duration"" value kicks in.  That default is ""14 seconds"" - and the ""seconds"" part is *not* changeable. I tried setting this to ""0"" (a common value to ""turn off"" a feature) - it reverted to ""14"".  I tried setting it to ""9999999999"" - which it allowed me to type in and then promptly crashed and cleared all my settings back to the defaults...  I currently have it set to ""1800"" - which should give me a voice prompt every 30 minutes.  (For the record, it has accepted values up to ""99999"" without crashing - which is almost 28 hours.)

One more thing with the settings - the ""Shake to Start/Stop"" option DOES NOT stay turned off.  No matter what I do, this option is *always* checked ""on"" when I re-open the Settings window.  The ""Vibrate On"" option is very often turned back on when I re-open the Settings window - though it doesn't seem to always get restored, like the other setting.

Next to these problems, the other comments I have are simply annoyances.

First, there is no easy way to set the time for the timer - you can't just type in the hours or minutes or seconds.  You have to use their popup window with little ""wheels"" for each value, that have to be clicked around.  Way too time-consuming, if all you wanted was to set a 2-minute timer for an egg!  The window comes up set to the last value that was input - if you enter ""45"" and later want to input ""15"" you have to click the little wheel 30 times, just to change it.  (You can go up or down, which is a little bit of a help, I suppose.)

So, I set up various preset timers to select from.  But, even though you can create a long list of ""preset"" timers, there doesn't seem to be any way to sort or re-order the list - so if you created timers for: 5 min, 10 min, 20 min, 15 min - they are listed in the order that you created them and there doesn't seem to be any way to put ""15 min"" after ""10 min"" and before ""20 min"" where it belongs... not a big issue if you have 4 presets, but a hassle if you have a long list of them.",very frustrating to use,1362268800,,,4067

In this day and age, I often need multiple, labeled countdown timers and stopwatches running at the same time - especially while cooking or tracking multiple events or event participants.

Another feature needed (I've only seen this on one app) is a countdown timer that cycles (ie activate every X number of hours for either X number of times, indefinite, or until a set time). For medical reasons, I need to wake-up every two hours while sleeping - it would be nice to have a countdown timer that simply activated its alarm at custom intervals. Currently I use a stand-alone kitchen timer that has four different countdown timers (I have to set the timers for 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours).

With today's technology and cornucopia of apps, developers need to be thinking outside of the box and make their apps feature rich in order to stand out.","Only one stopwatch and countdown timer, really?",1362268800,12.0,,932
3,True,"03 3, 2013",A3CJ0YQIEF9Q04,B009CC215Y,art,"When you think of a stopwatch and timer app, you probably don't expect it to have a bunch of features and options, but this one does. Some of the ones I think are pretty handy:

- it can automatically adjust the volume on your device (unfortunately it defaults to bumping it up to 100%, I guess expecting you'll use this in a noisy environment)
- you can use your device's volume buttons rather than the touchscreen for the start/stop and lap functions
- it provides speech and vibration updates of the time remaining in timer mode
- you can shake your device for the start/stop and lap functions
- You can play different sounds when the timer expires
- in timer mode you can define presets to quickly choose them if you use the same times repeatedly

Now, it's not perfect. None of these are really enough for me to dock it a star though:

- defaults to 100% volume
- defaults to voice prompts being on (kind of creepy)
- display is attractive enough, but not customizable at all
- phone's menu button doesn't do anything, instead you have to press the gear icon in the ui
- it was not clear how to set the start time in the timer (tap on the time display). I instead chose to add a preset, which was more steps.

The only feature I really thought this could use was a widget. I don't really need a fullscreen display for something like this and the widget would provide handy access.

edit: after playing with this in a couple real-life situations I am reducing the rating for a couple of reasons.

1. The math on the lap averages is completely wrong. blech.
2. The settings revert to the defaults all the time. blech!!!
3. Ok here's a fun one. I started the timer and it was using the default 30 second voice prompts. I changed it to 1 minute because I didn't want it announcing every 30 seconds. I'm not sure exactly what it did -- it seemed to announce once a minute, yes, but it announced the same 30 second intervals, which were of course wrong. And then when my 15 minute timer went off at the right time, the voice kept on announcing -- every 30 seconds this time.

Also I agree with those who have suggested multiple simultaneous timers. Perhaps make that a special feature in the paid version, which might just make this worth buying.","feature-rich and functional, but still needs work",1362268800,147.0,,2245

The problem is that this app doesn't live up to what PC users have been using for years. There is very little help in how to do things. Many features are missing that I feel are essential. Let's start with the fact that you can't change tempo key signature or time signature midway through your song. You can only choose those options at the very begginning. Once they're set you can't change them for that song. Just that alone is very limiting unless your knowledge of music notation is in the beginning stages. Placing notes is a tedious and often frustrating process. Unless you can count an entire measure the way you want it in your head BEFORE putting down the notes the app will automatically end a measure or insert rests for you. This means that if you weren't entirely sure how you wanted to place your notes and what value of their beat you will have to erase the rests and then the notes and try to get it right-- for every measure! If you try to hear what it sounds like it will also automatically put rests in for the remaining measure. It also has a low sound quality forcing me to use headphones and turn the volume all the way up. when you are composing or editing it zooms in on your current measure making it very difficult to look at the rest of your score. You can't even see the previous measure most of the time let alone another staff. It's like you have to have a photographic memory like Mozart. But if I did what would I need an android app for?

4,True,"12 10, 2012",A2TOCBLEE7NIXQ,B00AFVZ78O,Tony in SF,"This is more or less for Kindle Fire users:

I've tried the ""other"" wifi on/off app which - despite the nice graphic it has when used - ends up bringing you to a large full-screen black page with an on/off button, and then forces you to close the app to get rid of it. It also leaves a big icon in the carousel, which bugs me.

This new ""WiFi On/Off Toggle switcher"" is a bit better in the sense that it - instead of taking you away from the main ""bookshelf"" - only shows you a brief notification to tell you that your wifi has been switched On or Off. And as a great added bonus, it doesn't leave an annoying new huge icon in the carousel (I keep the app icon in the top row of my Favorites).

The things I DON'T like about this app won't keep me from using it, but it would be nice if the dev would fix them:

1) The ON/OFF notifications are nearly identical and therefor hard to tell apart when you're not paying attention or don't squint fast enough to read the small text in the small notification box. It would be so much better if the text was larger, colored, and BOLD: Green for WIFI ON, red for WIFI OFF, just as an example.

2) I agree with the first reviewer about the app icon: It's ugly and clunky and it could be a lot nicer. But then the app is free, so I won't complain much if it isn't changed. :P

So, that ""other app"" was a nice step forward for Fire users, but this one goes a step further and lets you just press the icon directly to toggle your wifi connection, which is the absolute best thing for us Fire users.

Thanks to the dev for providing this to us and for making it free!

NOTE: Be patient when pressing the icon: It can take a couple of seconds for your wifi to change states and for the status message to pop up.",Kindle Fire users: Great little app that could use a couple of tweaks,1355097600,4.0,,1747

It was just an ugly, clunky app for what little it did. WiFi On/Off Toggle switcher, on the other hand, sits in your carousel and when you press it, it just does its thing and tells you when it's done. No extra screens, no backing out, no ads, no time or finger gestures wasted. Simple and nearly perfect. My only complaint is the low-res icon. To be honest, it's a little ugly and low-tech looking on a tablet screen.

The application, once invoked, needs to run in addition to the mp3 player to hear its influence.

1,True,"01 21, 2015",A27IKYGZ3MQ8X6,B00ATTFGXS,Mike C,"The stopwatch that comes installed on the Note 4(and any newer device) is just as feature rich as this app, and obviously it's free. This app DOES read .00 in lap mode, but not in standard mode. My stock stopwatch app reads .00 in both lap AND standard mode. Others have mentioned this may be useful if you use Alarm Clock Extreme, and Alarm Clock Extreme is actually my daily alarm clock and the only one I use. That said, I still see no use whatsoever in having this app installed along side of it.
So, as a paid app I do not recommend this. And even as a free app, I still do not recommend this. Feel free to see for yourself, but only if you're simply wanting to waste some time.....",Why would anyone pay for this???,1421798400,,,687
3,True,"01 21, 2015",A1X1CEGHTHMBL1,B00ATTFGXS,JJCEO,"This app links itself into Alarm Clock Extreme that is written by the same developer. It is a simple stopwatch function with a flaw in my opinion. If you are going to use it there should be the ability to read out the time in 1/100ths of a second on a single timed event and yet this one only goes to 1/10ths of a second. I rarely use a stopwatch function on any of my tablets or phones. The only time is when I go to the Indy 500 track and clock the car's lap speeds. They actually clock the cars to 4 decimal places. Now I know that with human reaction times you cannot be that accurate but it just seems old fashion to only go to 1/10ths of a second. Oddly enough the timer tracks and stores the time to 1/100th of a second it just doesn't display it on the screen while the actual timing is going on. It does show it if you use the lap timer function. The only problem is that if you press Stop instead of Lap you can't see the 1/100ths decimal place.

This is an OK app but to be honest most of my tablets and phones have such timers already built in. I probably wouldn't purchase this app even for $0.99. Functionally it works fine but it is a common app function that comes with most tablets already. I rated it at 3 stars.
